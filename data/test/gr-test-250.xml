Farrah Fawcett has &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/26/arts/television/26fawcett.html"&gt;lost her three year battle with anal cancer&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Farrah Fawcett, an actress and television star whose good looks and signature flowing hairstyle influenced a generation of women and bewitched a generation of men, beginning with a celebrated pinup poster, died Thursday morning in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 62 and lived in West Los Angeles.
 
Her death, at St. John's Health Center, was caused by anal cancer, which she had been battling since 2006, said her spokesman, Paul Bloch.

&lt;p&gt;To an extraordinary degree, Ms. Fawcett's cancer battle was played out in public, generating enormous interest worldwide. Her face, often showing the ravages of cancer, became a tabloid fixture, and updates on her health became staples of television entertainment news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May, that battle was chronicled in a prime-time NBC documentary, "Farrah's Story," some of it shot with her own home video recorder. An estimated nine million people viewed it. Ms. Fawcett had initiated the project with a friend, the actress Alana Stewart, after she first learned of her cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I've written extensively about this on two occasions, first a year and a half ago when I learned that Fawcett had &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/10/farrah_fawcett_turns_to_alternative_medi.php"&gt;turned to woo&lt;/a&gt; after her anal cancer, which had seemingly been treated successfully, recurred; then again two months ago when she was &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/farrah_fawcett_and_alternative_cancer_cu.php"&gt;admitted to the hospital due to a complicationr&lt;/a&gt; from the therapy she was undergoing in Germany, including alternative methods; and then finally when I realized that my speculation of what therapy Fawcett had undergone in Germany was way off and I had to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/orac_screwed_up_it_looks_that_way.php"&gt;admit a rare mistake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of that really matters anymore..&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/farrah_fawcett_dead_of_cancer_at_age_62.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/farrah_fawcett_dead_of_cancer_at_age_62.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/RpEgRsmSpbE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245988101407"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/son_of_the_bride_of_the_thread.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9a94d62dbec4c18e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Open Thread"/><title type="html">Son of the Bride of the Thread That Will Not Die</title><published>2009-06-26T04:31:02Z</published><updated>2009-06-26T04:31:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/nziPVoAdmN0/son_of_the_bride_of_the_thread.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;IT'S STILL ALIVE!

Apparently the same behavior has been observed in sheep, but they’re not as funny as wallabies so they don’t make it into the headline, nor are they pictorially represented in this blog post, as such:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://img72.imageshack.us/img72/697/521930displayimagephpla.jpg" alt="Wallaby"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was going to leave the dragon-chasing wallabies as good, clean Quickie-fodder, the sheer tsunami of tips people are sending convinced me a full post is needed. I have very little to add to the story, except this: from now on, when someone offers you an anecdote to support their personal wacky theory, whether it concerns aliens buzzing cornfields or ghosts haunting mansions or NASA faking moon landings, your number one response should now be “&lt;strong&gt;maybe it was a doped-up wallaby&lt;/strong&gt;.” You never know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Seriously, thanks to all of you who sent this one in, and all of &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?page_id=1227/"&gt;you who continue to send in your tips&lt;/a&gt;!

&lt;p&gt;Today, Peter Binfield, the Managing Editor of PLoS ONE, published a paper entitled "PLoS ONE: Background, Future Development, and Article-Level Metrics" that covers all of that in great detail. The paper is, of course, Open Access, so you can download the PDF for free &lt;a href="http://conferences.aepic.it/index.php/elpub/elpub2009/paper/view/114/51" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and the related PowerPoint slideshow &lt;a href="http://conferences.aepic.it/index.php/elpub/elpub2009/paper/view/114/94" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/2009/06/25/plos-one-and-article-level-metrics/" title=""&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The paper goes into a lot of detail on the history and inner workings of PLoS ONE, and so if you are at all interested in where our journal came from; how it operates; and where it is going in the future, then it is required reading.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I second that! A Must Read!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, as this is a peer-reviewed article, if you blog about it, and if you use the BPR3 icon, the link to your blog post will show up on the &lt;a href="http://researchblogging.org/post-search/list?search_text=journal.pone" title=""&gt;ResearchBlogging.org&lt;/a&gt; aggregator and will thus be eligible for the &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/tag/blog-pick-of-the-month/" title=""&gt;Blog Pick Of The Month&lt;/a&gt; for June.&lt;/p&gt;

I heard Jill say the name of Alex’s teacher. “He’s sick?” I thought. “This morning of all mornings?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. Instead the teacher wanted to know if we’d gotten the message about dressing all the graduating kids in black and white for the ceremony? I had some memory of that but not a strong one — at this point in my parenthood only a drop of guilt can turn into a real past event in my head. Alex went to school in khakis and a T, and good luck getting him to wear anything else these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/06/alexgrad-300x225.jpg" alt="alexgrad" width="300" height="225"&gt;Teacher got him into a white baseball T. Alex was one of two kids in his special-needs class graduating, the rest of the graduates made up of kids from the typical school Alex’s classroom sits in. The kids were in summer dresses, little suits, some ties, all of their shoulders draped in the school’s purple grad banner. Most of the parents were dressed to match, minus the banners, of course. I showed up in cargo shorts and a short-sleeve button-down shirt and Chuck Taylors. Why hadn’t I foreseen this moment? For a moment I told myself that being the parent of a kid like Alex should give me a built-in excuse, but that sounded feeble the instant I said it to myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t, and the moment soon took me in the throat. There were all the kids and all the awards, all the balloons and all the digitial camera phones and all the applause – no great amount of the latter but certainly no small amount of it, either, for Alex and his autistic classmate, even as Alex kept escaping on stage to see what was behind the drawn curtain. In his white baseball T and khakis. Once he got a laugh. Halfway through the ceremony, I saw he’d shed his banner. He won an award for reading, along with four typically-developing students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About that same time, it hit me that this was it. Jill has already talked about the kindness of this place, a kindness I confess I’ve taken for granted for six years. It hit me that maybe this was the end of this kind of kindness, for a little while, and I just didn’t know it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving too was the assistant principal, off to assume the big chair at a special-needs school in Queens. She was a unit teacher when we met her a few years ago, rising soon to assistant principal, and this fall, when Alex gets off the bus in a strange place and it hits him that “school” now means something dramatically different, she will be far away. I’ll miss her and miss them all in the way I didn’t realize until this ceremony, when it feels like I graduated in a way, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patient A, a 41-year-old Taiwanese male, suffered from intermittent dysthymia which presented with minor low mood, insomnia, anxiety, chest tightness, back pain, and subjectively mild occupational difficulty... patient A received a single chiropractic spinal manipulation. The chiropractor noticed a minor deformity in the thoracic spine, and a traction technique was administered. He experienced immediate relief from back pain. The following day he reported complete relief of chest tightness, dysthymia, fatigue, and insomnia, with HAM-D, TDQ, and VAS scores of 0 for all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No, no, I&amp;#39;m fine now, no need to do any more chiropractic on me, I&amp;#39;ll be off then...”&lt;/p&gt;

I've posted a few of the ones you find on the front page so far. This will allow people who don't have Blogger accounts to discuss our ideas. Joe has a dedicated staff there so I expect things will go smoothly. The link takes you to the DC page but don't forget to click on the banner to discuss and/or start threads of your own. To register click on the link in the upper left hand corner. For now we'll also allow comments here at DC for regular Bloggers. This is a test run.

I've been writing about using &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/a_little_talk_and_a_lot_of_pictures"&gt;less talk and more visuals&lt;/a&gt; to help Charlie throughout the day, and in &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/aac_again_beyond_words"&gt;communicating with him&lt;/a&gt;. It's occurring to me that these visuals and images aren't necessarily how Charlie visualizes things. They're based on what we think might be an accurate, or at least a helpful, representation, of how he takes in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know we could be really really wrong. I was reminded of this recently when I showed Charlie a card for "bike riding" and he said "black car"---I took another look and there was the back end of our car in the photo, to the left of Charlie astride his bike: Same photo, different focuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The June 23rd &lt;a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/miami_dade/beaches/story/1109426.html"&gt;Miami Herald&lt;/a&gt; reports on an exhibition of artwork created by developmentally disabled adults. There's an interesting twist in how the artists were asked to conceive of their work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It isn't always easy for someone with autism to communicate -- much less share their innermost feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for Miami Beach artists Stewart and Dena Stewart, helping those who are hard to reach put their emotions on canvas has become a calling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For months, the Stewarts -- co-founders of the Beach-based Center for Folk and Community Art -- have helped a group of developmentally disabled adults create pieces of artwork that reflect their life stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;''We asked everybody to write something about what they would like people to know about them,'' said Stewart. ``Then, based on what they've written, we show them how to create their own artwork to go along with the stories.''&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, Charlie has not yet shown himself inclined to represent his thoughts, wishes, ideas in writing. So we keep looking, though I'm still regularly stumped about how to understand what he's thinking. Arrangements like &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autismland/3651915917/"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; help quite a bit: It seems that he sees things in terms of patterns of colors, textures, materials (metal and plastic utensils) and shapes. Things get placed into rows (and the hardwood floorboards help).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of which gives me a lot to think about.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org&amp;#39;s Autism Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245970454205"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/michael_jackson_dead.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9db063fa3c7e5aa1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="News"/><title type="html">Michael Jackson dead</title><published>2009-06-25T23:36:18Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T23:36:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/2ONLpk4bThM/michael_jackson_dead.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;How strange: he was a little younger than me (but not much!), so it's sad to learn that the &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Music/06/25/michael.jackson/index.html"&gt;King of Pop has died of a heart attack&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;I was away in Nature – with a real capital N,  and decided to insert an allegory this week instead of a medical subject. The genesis here was a sweeping of the mind and brushing away of cobwebs and detritus called worries and other preoccupations.  The application to this here blog is - methodology. The experience is one of discovery, and of loss, and of bearing the burden of inaction.   &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;Some thirty or more years ago a family member became enamored of a new book, The Teachings of don Juan by an unknown author, Carlos Castaneda. But mention the name now and one gets one of two responses: Who is that?  Or, Oh, he is that literary fraud.  But in the late 1960s – 1970s, two social movements had captured imaginations of youth, academics, and much of the intellectual world. They made fantasy seem plausible, and fraud seem believable – psychedelics and postmodernism. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;Advocates of psychedelics, most of whom experienced drug-induced alterations,  promoted revolutionary psychological ideas such as drug-induced multiple realities.  The other, postmodernism, was and is the intellectual and philosophical movement originating in academia that similarly views of reality(ies) as possibly multiple.  (The relation, if any, to alternate universes and relativity theories in physics I have to leave to philosophers.) But the ‘60s and ‘70s were decades of several revolutions in social and personal thought – paradigm changes – that brought fairy tales, delusions, and irrationality onto realms of plausibility, from which we are still reeling, and trying to deal with.  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;Carlos Castaneda wrote eight books (or was it nine?) on the same subject. He related meeting Yaqui Indian seer and healer don Juan Matus at an Arizona bus station and following him through mountains of Mexican Sonora and a series of hallucinatory drug-induced episodes and lessons of life. Later books introduced different main characters (la Catalina, don Gennaro.) At least three books made the NY Times best seller list, and all netted him millions of dollars.  His books sold well even well after his exposure as a fraud and plagiarist.  The psychedelic and postmodern mental states apparently became dominant enough and entrenched enough in modern folklore that believers could not yield their comfort with fantasy. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;Then, after mentioning the name Castaneda, state the name Richard de Mille, and chances are neither one questioned will know who that is. Richard de Mille (1924-2009 died April 9. I found this out after starting this post. Richard (most people were on first name basis with him, as was I) was author of two key books on Castaneda, both written in the 1970s: Castaneda’s Journey, the Power and the Allegory, and The don Juan Papers.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;Through Richard de Milles’s diligence and intellectual power, Carlos Castaneda was exposed as a fraud, and his eight books describing psychedelic rituals and perceptions of Yaqui Indians of Sonora were proved to be mislabeled creative fiction. Castaneda did not deny the charge and never brought legal charges against de Mille. (After the first $1 million, who cares, might even have been good for business?) &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;I read Castaneda’s The Teachings on a ski trip in 1970 or so.  Fascinating.  Given the 1960s psychedelic experiences, don Juan Matus, the Yaqui teacher, who leaped vast distances and moved immovable objects or whose spirit could transform into an animal, kneaded and molded younger minds into trying to concurrently rationalize, imagine, and dream single experiences in differing forms. Castaneda described standard interpretations of reality as “ordinary reality” and a others as a “special reality.”  Another of his book titles was “A Separate Reality.” &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;The process of reading and following Castaneda’s odyssey required toying with mind-bending ideas.  One such was human perception itself being faulty in that it disallowed more than one form of reality at a time.   If this does not make sense to the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century mind, it didn’t make sense to this 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century mind then, either, although not for lack of trying. .&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;I read the first Castaneda books, and was left in a limbo between, possibility and improbability and the author’s delusional thinking or drug-induced hallucinations. The confusion was aided by the appendix of the first book, The Teachings of don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge, which was the ostensibly real summary of Castaneda’s field work with don Juan for which he was awarded his PhD in anthropology at UCLA. The method used was ethnomethodology, in which the investigator is not a distant observer of a society’s social behavior, but an active participant in it. The investigation becomes experiential.  And, in the process, scientific method becomes something other than science. But that was the new standard of the time.  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;Complementing such neo-ideation, was/is the takeover of academic departments and faculty by postmodernism, the neo-philosophy that formalizes varying perceptions and formulations of reality, going so far in some views to proclaim that language creates reality. It was and is an academic world where almost anything is possible, and there are no ground rules for determining the borders. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;Castaneda’s PhD thesis had a ring of fantasy. Castaneda could not produce his original field notes – essential in supporting a PhD thesis – claiming that they were destroyed in a flooded basement of his Westwood residence. (Floods in Westwood?)  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;I began heated discussions about the writings because I became more and more skeptical and found what I thought were some errors of timing and of psychedelic plant use (no, I never smoked, inhaled, ingested, etc.)  But just because of an error or two I could not dismiss the rest of it – a PhD, after all.  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;At about that time I was introduced to skeptical thinking through a local community college symposium at which several CSICOP members from Buffalo, NY spoke – and by an ensuing subscription to Skeptical Inquirer.  It was in an early SI issue that I read a review of de Mille’s book or books, which I promptly bought and spent weeks devouring.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;The first book, Castaneda’s Journey, is itself an allegory as the title states.  Written as a partial imitation of Castaneda, de Mille introduces an imagined - or maybe not - meeting of himself and Castaneda, and an ensuing series of real-or-not meetings and dialogues in which de Mille is the student-seeker, and Carlos the mysterious shadow appearing-disappearing Teacher.  This short work is itself a masterwork of layered, allegorical story-telling.  This book is still in print, and I highly recommend it. Like good music or fine wine, enjoy the literary pleasure. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;But Richard’s other major works were as different as phyla. The don Juan Papers traces Castaneda’s academic works in cultural anthropology at UCLA, through comments from his advisers, others who had input into the granting of the degree, and outside observers.  The conclusion of most: the thesis was a work of fiction, perhaps based in some personal experiences, but mostly in works of others, knowledge of other cultural rituals and myths, synthesized into a nearly plausible epic analysis of the occult mysteries of native American tribes. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;Perhaps most fascinating for us types is the inability of some academics to discard their beliefs, or to resolve their cognitive dissonance in some rational way…they continued to rationalize the episode of being taken in as good illustrative methodology, containing kernels of truth, and other face-saving imaginings. Academia. Peer review. Not always what we would like them to be. Humans run them. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt; The department chairman retains his silence in the matter, as embarrassing as it is. To complement the work is a series of analyses and commentaries by other prominent social anthropologists. It is at times heavy going through anthro-sociology jargon and working concepts. Four hundred pages of it, fortunately and mercifully punctuated at crucial points by de Mille’s interpretation, and identifying of contradictions. Indexed and notated in detail, this is the work of an accomplished academician researcher.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;In both works, I marveled at de Mille’s attention to detail, to the lengths of comparing time intervals and dates of the same events in several books. It took a great memory and talent to see the contradictions, so often obscure and separated in place and context. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;I asked Richard to contribute an article on his methods to Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine, which he did.  [De Mille R, How I Learned Not to Believe Carlos Castaneda. Sci Rev Altern Med 1999; 3(2):11-14.] He has a short section devoted to some of this in each book as well. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;Richard’s method derived directly from his academic career, about which I had forgotten. He had both MA and PhD in psychology, spent brief times at USC and UC Santa Barbara faculties, and more time as an industrial and career psychologist, and had done considerable research in various related fields. He said to the effect of, “I merely strolled over to the UCSB library and applied what I had learned.”  He became an authority on social anthropology and ethnography – and a professional skeptic researcher along the way. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;I later read his autobiographical and biographical portraits of himself and his prominent mother, (My Secret Mother, Lorna Moon.) a script writer in Hollywood, who bore him out of wedlock to Cecil B. de Mille’s brother, William. Sin and secrecy were the behavior modes at the time, not public confessions or live-in arrangements, so Cecil B. raised Richard as his son, not telling him his real father was Cecil’s brother until William’s death, when Richard was in his thirties.  Interestingly (to me) is that for part of his childhood he lived on the same L.A. street as my grandmother. We might have crossed “paths.” Perhaps not.  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;The heart of this tale is that Richard de Mille, himself the guiltless player of a real life mirage, was the key who exposed the largest literary and academic fraud in history, using techniques of research, objective methodology, intelligence, and diligence.  Studying his methods I was able to construct techniques for teaching that I used years later, and that many other skeptics have developed as well. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;Richard de Mille was a mild, retiring giant intellect with (insert superlative) writing talent. He was generous with time and a most gracious human being.  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;The lament:  I wanted to write a re-review of one or both of Richard’s Castaneda books, but did not get around to it. I always wanted to visit him in Santa Barbara where he lived, but delayed in that also. A lesson re-learned all too frequently.     &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear PZ,
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The work of my lab has been subject to questions and harsh criticisms, some reasonable, some not.  The scientific ones are dealt with in a new book &lt;i&gt;On The Origin Of Form, Evolution by Self-Organization, an alternative to the natural selection paradigm&lt;/i&gt;, This is a substantially expanded presentation of the self-organization model previously published. 
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I welcome your assessment. If you are convinced now of its plausibility, as are many others, I solicit your participation in the dissemination of the idea for further investigation. A copy is on its way.  Meanwhile, please see  www.ontheoriginofform.com&lt;br&gt;
SP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uh-oh. Pivar, you may recall, is the fellow who tried to &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/08/so-sue-me.html"&gt;sue me for FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS&lt;/a&gt; two years ago, all over my &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/07/lifecode_from_egg_to_embryo_by.php"&gt;review of his book, &lt;i&gt;Lifecode&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That tends to damp my enthusiasm for any more books from him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not reply. He sent me an update a few days later, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear PZ,
   
The new book presents a model of self organization amplified well beyond that shown previously, addressing, among many other issues, the reasons that the idealized models are inconsistent with parts of observed embryology. Many prominent scientists have now accepted the plausibility of the model.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you plan to comment publicly kindly view this new material. You will probably find the premise plausible
as well. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
see www.ontheoriginofform.com  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Stuart  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plausible? It must have undergone significant revision, then, since in its earlier incarnation, it was best described as surreal and absurd. Then the book arrives in my mailbox; you can even &lt;a href="http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1556438869/pharyngula-20" title="buy this book at amazon"&gt;preorder it on Amazon now&lt;/a&gt;, and just look at the encomiums published on the cover!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Stuart Pivar's book, On the Origin of Form, contains ideas that deserve full scientific scrutiny, especially in light of the turmoil roiling evolutionary biology at present. Pivar is presenting, in a series of brilliantly rendered graphical diagrams that show his interpretation of how modifications of a torus shape can generate a vast panoply of biotic form, a new theory of morphogenesis.... This is a seismic event for science. Conventional evolutionary biologists are right to be very worried about this, because it has the potential to trigger the complete collapse of Modern Synthesis Biology."&lt;br&gt;

The assumption that is made is that some chemical or brain anomaly causes "insistence on sameness."  In other words, that "insistence on sameness" is a maladaptive behavior that may be correctable.  The casual qualitative research that happens in one's head simply from communicating with hundreds of people who share the same experience (i.e. are all on the spectrum) makes me question this assumption, at least for some of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience of many of us is not that "insistence on sameness" jumps out unbidden and unwanted and makes our lives hard, but that "insistence on sameness" is actually a way of adapting to a confusing and chaotic environment, cueing into volitional action, or compensating for "executive function" difficulties.  Routines for some of us are the opposite of unbidden, unwanted, or difficulty-making: they are deliberate, desired, and adaptive.  (Which may explain in turn why some of us become unable to function well, or become extremely upset, when our routines are broken.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anecdotal stories are not, in themselves, science.  They do not "prove" anything other than that a particular person has had a specific experience.  However, the starting assumptions or hypothesis that are used in science frequently do come from observation, including observation of people's first hand accounts of their experiences.  If you hear enough autistic adults talking, typing, signing, drawing about how frustrated they are about not being able to get quality health care, then you may develop a more testable hypothesis or assumption for use in a study, like "autistic adults often do not receive quality health care."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When reading about these studies that assume autistic behavior is maladaptive, I always wonder if the investigators have spent much time asking autistic people about our experiences or why we may have the behavior they are interested in studying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding our personal reasons for doing things is really important as it filters down to a practical day-to-day level because a therapy or medication that eliminates or suppresses an adaptive behavior could potentially be harmful, not beneficial, to a person (any person!) in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org&amp;#39;s Autism Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245958563372"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=13953">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/487bd583f418e4ac</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="fred shapiro"/><category term="quote"/><title type="html">Quotes Uncovered: Pork and Patriotism</title><published>2009-06-25T19:26:20Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T19:26:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/25/quotes-uncovered-pork-and-patriotism/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/" type="html">A while back, I invited readers to submit quotations for which they wanted me to try to trace the origins, using &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Yale-Book-Quotations-Fred-Shapiro/dp/0300107986"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Yale Book of Quotations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and more recent research by me.

Oh, I don’t fret over it for long, and I’ve never really come to a conclusion about it, but sometimes in moments of loneliness or after a relationship ends, I wonder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if in fact I am hard to love, it’s because of the man I have become. Perhaps my personality, my attitude, and my many vices and odd peccadillos are enough to turn people away. Perhaps the culmination of those many things is what makes it hard to love me. Me, the grown man version of Sam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But apparently it is hard to love some &lt;em&gt;babies &lt;/em&gt;for much simpler reasons. According to &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1906642,00.html?cnn=yes"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, a new study released by Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital and published in the online journal &lt;em&gt;PloS One&lt;/em&gt; suggests that uglier babies are harder to love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, men and women were randomly shown pictures of 50 healthy and attractive babies and 30 others with distinct facial irregularities. Each picture remained on the screen for four seconds, but the viewer could shorten that time by clicking one key or prolong it by clicking another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, the men in the study were less likely to click off photos of unattractive babies, but clicked quite a bit to hold on to the images of the pretty ones. Women, conversely, left the keyboard alone when they were looking at pretty babies, but hurried away from the less attractive ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;So . . . Do you see any flaws in the study? If so, how would you improve on it? Would you even bother? Is an ugly baby really harder to love? Are you now trying to recall the nature of your early relationship with your mother?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Good news, we're getting it back. The &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.savebritishscience.org.uk/"&gt;Campaign for Science &amp;amp; Engineering&lt;/a&gt; had this to say:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Campaign for Science &amp;amp; Engineering (CaSE) warmly welcomed the House of Commons&amp;#39; decision to establish the Science and Technology Committee. CaSE lobbied for it to be established following the merger of DIUS and BIS. In today&amp;#39;s debate &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/philwillismp"&gt;Phil Willis MP&lt;/a&gt; commended CaSE's efforts to bring back the Science and Technology Committee.&lt;br&gt;
Commenting Nick Dusic, CaSE's Director, said:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is great news that the Science and Technology Committee will be able to investigate science and engineering issues that cut right across government, including the science budget.&lt;br&gt;
Today's decision showed that there is strong support for proper scrutiny of science and engineering within Parliament. It is critical that future changes to government do not result in the abolition of the Science and Technology Committee. Today's decision corrects the mistake made in 2007 of abolishing the Committee.&lt;br&gt;
I look forward to working with the Science and Technology Committee in scrutinising the Government's science policies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Committee will be able to conduct wide-ranging inquiries, covering the full scope of science policy and related matters including the science budget. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/06/science_watchdog_returns_to_we.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author><name>SciencePunk</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245956893320"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=13961">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fdba86f1a260263b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="employment"/><category term="wages"/><title type="html">Trading Overtime</title><published>2009-06-25T17:22:01Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T17:22:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/25/trading-overtime/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/" type="html">The latest &lt;em&gt;Economist&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href="http://www.economist.com/businessfinance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13871834"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; about an Italian firm whose workers negotiated a deal during the recession for time off with no pay cut in exchange for promises to work overtime without extra pay when the firm's demand recovers.</summary><author><name>By Daniel Hamermesh</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml</id><title type="html">Freakonomics</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245956494840"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/send_grrlscientist_to_antarcti.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/55d326f8dd5954cd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><title type="html">Send GrrlScientist to Antarctica!</title><published>2009-06-25T19:26:09Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T19:26:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/B4silXXPtUI/send_grrlscientist_to_antarcti.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m really not being mean and trying to banish a fellow science blogger to some barren, frigid desolation — hey, that&amp;#39;s where I live! — but she&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/2009/06/the_gift_of_an_adventure_of_a.php"&gt;&lt;i&gt;volunteering&lt;/i&gt; to leave New York for a month to live in Antarctica&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked one of my SciBlings and friends, Scicurious of the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neurotopia/" title=""&gt;Neurotopia&lt;/a&gt;, to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Who are you? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="SciCurious pic.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/SciCurious%20pic.jpg" width="235" height="267" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 20px 0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;My name is Scicurious (please, call my Sci), and I'm a grad student studying Pharmacology at a Southeastern University of Good Reputation.  Every once in a while, I think I see the end of the tunnel, but it turns out I was fooling myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do you want to do/be when (and if ever) you grow up?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Mad Scientist.  MWAH-HA-HA-HA.  Honestly, it's amazing how many of us didn't know what to do with ourselves after college, and now it's amazing how many of us don't know what to do with ourselves after grad school.  I guess I better begin thinking of that right about now, huh...it will definitely involve world domination. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is your Real Life job?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grad student.  It's a lot less glamorous than it sounds.  I don't suffer at all from paparazzi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really love learning in a wide variety, and sharing ideas with a large number of people.  I love that, since beginning to read science blogs, I've found out so much more about my field, and expanded my knowledge base in other fields.  I think it's the spread of knowledge to both other scientists and lay people that interests me the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my real work?  It doesn't.  I blog on my own time, and never on my Real Work.  However, you can find me on Twitter, and I hear there's a Facebook group as well.  I love blogging and sharing information and educating, but work and blogging need to stay separate for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But indirectly, there's been a massive effect of blogging on my work.  My knowledge of other areas has increased exponentially, and now it seems that the instant something big comes out in my field, I know.  So it's been a positive influence, over all.  And I've made some awesome friends and contacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and how did you discover science blogs? What are some of your favourites?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funny, that.  See, I went to this coffee shop one day and met this guy Coturnix.  I hear you know him...  Someone had told me that he could help me break into the world of science writing.  And he told me to start a science blog.  So I spent the next day or so checking out blogs, and thinking "hey!  This is pretty sweet!"  And thus, Scicurious was born. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Favorites?  I hate playing favorites.  I have to say I LOVE "&lt;a href="http://whatis-wrong-withyou.blogspot.com" title=""&gt;What the hell is wrong with you, I'm mean, damn&lt;/a&gt;" because the title kills me.  I go there when I'm feeling down just to read the title and laugh.  Otherwise, I've got a LOT of blogs I read every day.  Everyone has their good and bad days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You led a &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/History_of_Science/" title=""&gt;session about History of Science&lt;/a&gt; at the conference - how did that go and what did you learn from it?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I've never led a session on ANYTHING before, so I guess it went well for my first time!  It was great to have gg and Laelaps there with me, I love those guys.  Gg in particular knows SO much about the history of science, and has so much to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we started some good discussions.  One question that really interested me was "why does this MATTER?!"  I was kind of shocked, because I personally love history, and so it never really occurred to me that people wouldn't think it mattered.  But it did make me think about why people should blog about the history of science. After all, a lot of times it's not easy to do, looking up and explaining old techniques.  But I think we were able to show a little of WHY the history of science is important.  I personally think that the history of science is necessary to explain a great deal of what goes on the modern biosciences, a lot of which can be really complicated if you don't have some idea of the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It seems that blog posts on three topics - Historical Science, Weird Science, and Science of Sex - draw a lot of interest from your readers. But as you know, most of currently done science is not that sexy - how do you balance this for your audience?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ALL well-done, elegant science is sexy science!  I also like to explain a lot of the more complicated topics, and try to make science understandable to a non-scientist audience.  I try to convey how excited I was when I first learned about the topics, and I hope that gets other people excited about some of the "less-sexy" science as well, when it is conveyed by people who are passionate and who can explain how the heavy stuff relates to every day life. Sure, some science is funny and weird, and some of it's not, but all of it is important and helps us to understand our bodies and the world that we live in.  New knowledge is always pretty exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You are the guest editor of the Open Laboratory 2009 anthology - any thoughts about it yet?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agreed to do what now?  Aiieeeeeeee!!!! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I just hope I can do as well as the previous years have done.  We've already got boatloads of submissions coming in, many of which look like good contenders.  I'm just hoping I turn out something awesome and that I don't go insane doing it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I will say that I think there's a lot to be said for meeting bloggers in person.  When they are a disembodied series of words, it is very easy to misinterpret.  There is no tone of voice on the internet  And also, you can build up pictures in your head of these blogging gods, and in reality, we're all just people.  So it was very cool to meet some of the people I've been communicating with for ages, and see what they're really like.  Now sometimes I can even hear them talking when I read them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also really impressed with the sessions on anonymity and women and minorities in science.  Even though I AM a woman in science, it was something that I had never really thought about before.  I have since become a lot more aware of these issues, and I've been reading up a lot on them as well.  I hope that conversations about women and minority issues at conferences continue, I think there's a lot left to be discussed, and there are ALWAYS more people to educate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to see you again and thank you for the interview. I hope to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/scienceonline09_interview_with_2.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/fwtkraHiyt8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245955305273"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1540">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/95faf5f9b1050edd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="passives"/><title type="html">Insufficient agency!</title><published>2009-06-25T18:10:15Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T18:10:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1540" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;On her blog, Elizabeth Daingerfield Zwicky &lt;a href="http://www.otoh.org"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; an encounter between her daughter Opal (now 5) and the passive voice:&lt;/p&gt;

I’ll be the moderator for the Mythbusters panel at &lt;a href="http://www.comic-con.org/cci/"&gt;Comic Con&lt;/a&gt; this year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Squeeee!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comic Con is a HUGE scifi/fantasy/comic/gaming/pop culture convention held every year in San Diego. I’ve always wanted to go, and last year, &lt;del&gt;the Hive Overmind&lt;/del&gt; Discover Magazine sent me there to be on a panel about science in science fiction (I have several blog posts about it; &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/07/24/comic-con-day-1-doctor-who-panel/"&gt;start here&lt;/a&gt; and click through to the next ones, in particular &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/07/30/comic-con-my-panel-on-science-and-scifi/"&gt;this one with a video of our panel&lt;/a&gt;). They’re sending me again this year (and I’ll have more about that a little later), and I’m &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; excited to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then last week I get a call from My Close Personal Friend Adam Savage™, asking me if I’d like to moderate their panel! I said yes immediately (and then cleared it with the magazine; maybe I did that a little backwards), because despite all indications I’m not a complete idiot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/2716534115/sizes/l/in/set-72157606342123292/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3096/2716534115_c3fa52a230_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/donttrythis"&gt;Adam&lt;/a&gt; will be on the panel, as well as Jamie Hyneman, Tory Belleci, and &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/GrantImahara"&gt;Grant Imahara&lt;/a&gt;. Kari can’t attend, as by then she’ll be a brand new mommy. That’s wonderful for her, of course, though a bit of a bummer for us. Adam and Jamie were on a panel at CC last year (that’s the picture shown here) and it was a riot. This year, the room is twice as big, too. Discovery Channel has more info &lt;a href="http://press.discovery.com"&gt;on their press release&lt;/a&gt; (PDF; click that link, select your location and &amp;quot;Discovery Channel&amp;quot; for network, then click the link on the right labeled &amp;quot;Mythbusters Comic Con panelists&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the panel we’ll be talking about the new season, what they have planned for the next, and how &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/08/27/mythbustin-the-moon-hoax-part-v-the-review/"&gt;their Moon Hoax testing episode&lt;/a&gt; would have been an unwatchable disaster without my science advice. I’ll really try to come up with some unusual questions for them, but I could use some help from you, me droogs. If you’ve got a good question for the ‘busters, put it in the comments below… and if I use it I’ll give you a shout-out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And may I just say once again: squeee!&lt;/p&gt;

Every situation is unique, and it’s usually far more complex then just calmly explaining to the believer why they are out of their minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many situations, it is possible to have a positive influence on someone who believes a con. It’s doubtful that you’ll be able to convince them in one conversation, but it’s very likely that you can give them the tools they need to eventually come to a more rational conclusion. You can encourage them to seek out the facts, teach them about common logical fallacies, or just demonstrate that it’s okay to doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some situations, though, deal with the so-called True Believer. The TB (not to be confused with tuberculosis—we’ve developed a vaccine for that) is well-known in the skeptical community as an unmovable brick wall of irrationality, someone best left alone to their delusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I agree that there are a good deal of hard cases out there, and probably even a good deal of people who will never change their minds about anything, I don’t think it’s healthy or correct to be pessimistic about the TB’s situation. For example, I’ve received lots of messages from former True Believers, talking about their journey into skepticism via blogs, podcasts, books, friends, and a good deal of inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s another reason why we shouldn’t be too quick to dismiss True Believers: we may not be able to change their minds, but we may still be able to help them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This occurred to me after reading &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124520056162621509.html"&gt;this Wall Street Journal article&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="http://consumerist.com/5295329/how-to-protect-susceptible-relatives-from-scams"&gt;Consumerist&lt;/a&gt;) about a very specific type of True Believer: the mentally incapacitated relative. These are mostly older parents and grandparents who have lost the batteries to their bullshit detectors, and so they fall for otherwise obvious scams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article gives some extreme examples and goes into ways that you can help your loved ones, even when they refuse to believe they’re being conned. Some of their tips include putting your loved one’s phone number on the Do Not Call list, giving them a script to use when answering the phone, or filling their time with other activities. One tip is even helpful to those of us who are already skeptics: “Gather scam mail in an envelop marked ‘Forward to Post Master: suspected mail fraud’ and put it in your mailbox. No postage is necessary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m wondering if any of our readers have elderly or mentally handicapped loved ones who fall for scams. If so, have you taken any steps to protect them? Are you on the look-out for scammers who may target them? Do you tell your grandparents about scams in the hopes that they’ll remember?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245953679854"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/06/25/women-in-space-we-um-salute-you/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/02524f7e579c5abe</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Food and Drink"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="space shuttle cake"/><title type="html">Women in Space — We …um… salute you</title><published>2009-06-25T17:21:37Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T17:21:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/06/25/women-in-space-we-um-salute-you/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a diehard baker of &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/04/30/the-physics-of-chocolate/"&gt;extreme&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/01/07/drive-by-posting/"&gt;cakes&lt;/a&gt;, I understand the difficulty in complex cake construction.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strangely enough, you're right. People shout My Name when they have sex, because I am all one can think of when they're orgasmic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is all wrong, a myth that another patriarchal myth has promoted to his advantage. I have carried out extensive empirical research in this area for approximately 35 years, and not once have I encountered a woman who shouted out any deity's name at any time during sex. However, I have discovered one consistent phenomenon, a remarkably robust pattern of behavior that I've seen over and over again, in almost ten thousand encounters. There is one name that godless women frequently evoke at the height of passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mine.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next time some sneering, mocking Christian asks you &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/07/what_is_a_good_erotic_exclamat.php"&gt;what atheists say during sex&lt;/a&gt;, you&amp;#39;ve now got the data: they moan &amp;quot;…PZ…&amp;quot;.

I admit that I was wrong. I thought that the &lt;a href="http://ling.ed.ac.uk/grammar/passives.html"&gt;grammatical term&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/index.php?s=passive+voice"&gt;&lt;em&gt;passive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had developed a spectrum of everyday meanings like "vague about agency", "listless writing, lacking in vigor", and "failure to take sides in a conflict". But I've now reluctantly concluded that for some members of the chattering classes, it now means nothing at all, except maybe "I dislike this person".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence that drove me over the edge? Hank Stuever and Wil Haygood, "&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/24/AR2009062403581.html"&gt;Parsing The Book Of Mark&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, 6/25/2009:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Wow. Was that a press conference or was &lt;em&gt;that a press conference?&lt;/em&gt; That genteel lilt of hubris, sorrow, guilt! But other than a very slow, meandering build to &lt;em&gt;I just needed a little strange,&lt;/em&gt; what did it all mean? What language was South Carolina's Republican governor speaking yesterday as he forlornly told the world of his travels and travails, of how sorry he is to his wife, to his sons, to his staff, to "the Tom Davises of the world" (not the Virginia one, all the other ones)? Is it a new Pat Conroy novel? Is it a megachurch sermon? Is it the language of couples therapy? The metaphysics of Oprah? Shakespeare? The psychobabble of cheating husbands? (&lt;strong&gt;Note all the passive constructions, the avoidance of first person.&lt;/strong&gt;) &lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;[emphasis added]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Before we get to the "passive constructions" part of "parsing the book of Mark", let's look at that "avoidance of first person". The 2,747 words of the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/24/us/24text-sanford.html?pagewanted=print"&gt;NYT transcript&lt;/a&gt; of Gov. Sanford's remarks include 190 first-person singular pronouns, for a rate of 6.9%, which seems pretty respectable even for a confession. In comparison, Barack Obama was &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1495"&gt;slammed by another WaPo writer, George Will&lt;/a&gt;, for being &amp;quot;inordinately fond of the first-person singular pronoun&amp;quot; in his GM take-over speech, which contained 1.7% of the same words.  This would be a case of damned if you do (&amp;quot;inordinately fond of the first person&amp;quot;) and damned if you don&amp;#39;t (&amp;quot;avoidance of first person&amp;quot;) — except that at the Post these days, you&amp;#39;re apparently damned for doing if you don&amp;#39;t, and damned for not doing if you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my topic today is &amp;quot;all the passive constructions&amp;quot;. In the section of Gov. Sanford&amp;#39;s press conference before the question period, I count 180 tensed verbs, of which I can find only four instances of grammatical passive voice, plus one or two more adjectival passives — and none of these are in the part of the statement where he describes his affair, or are connected to anything that seems remotely like psychobabble, of cheating husbands or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In three of the genuine passives, the unnamed but implied agent is &lt;em&gt;the media&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;… what I have found in this job is that one desperately needs a break from the bubble wherein every word, every moment &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;is recorded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;… it &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;was always viewed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as, "You're doing this to climb some further political office." It &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;was always based&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on that idea, that I genuinely believed that that action would be bad for the taxpayers …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the last one, the unnamed but implied agent is God:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;… if you were to look at God&amp;#39;s laws, they&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;'re in every instance designed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to protect people from themselves …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Yes, I know that I should count up all the infinitives and participles as well, but life is too short. Please feel free to contribute your labor to the cause, if you like to count things and have some spare time — for now, I&amp;#39;ll simply assert in a qualitative way that looking at infinitives and participles doesn&amp;#39;t change the picture in a material way.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, what about the currently popular interpretation of "passive voice" (or in this case "passive constructions") as meaning something like "vague about agency"? For example, when Bernie Madoff said that "I believed it [his Ponzi scheme] would end soon", Nancy Franklin in the New Yorker &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1242"&gt;commented&lt;/a&gt; that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;[H]e betrayed no sense of how absurd it was to use the passive voice in regard to his scheme, as if it were a spell of bad weather that had descended on him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the weird thing is, Gov. Sanford emphasized his own responsibility in first person active sentences, over and over again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;And so the bottom line is this: I have been unfaithful to my wife. I developed a relationship with a — what started out as a dear, dear friend from Argentina. It began very innocently, as I suspect many of these things do, in just a casual e-mail back and forth, in advice on one&amp;#39;s life there and advice here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;But here recently over this last year, it developed into something much more than that. And as a consequence, I hurt her. I hurt you all. I hurt my wife. I hurt my boys. I hurt friends like Tom Davis. I hurt a lot of different folks. And all I can say is that I apologize.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True, he describes the progression of the affair in two impersonal sentences: &amp;quot;It began very innocently … But … it developed into something much more&amp;quot;. On the other hand, these two sentences are surrounded by no fewer than nine sentences with first-person singular subjects confessing agency: &amp;quot;I have been unfaithful … I developed a relationship … I  hurt her. I hurt you all. I hurt my wife. I hurt my boys. I hurt friends …  I hurt a lot of … folks. … I apologize.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for Sanford to describe his affair as something he alone did would have been offensively narcissistic, it seems to me — it takes two, as they say, to tango.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what in the world did Stuever and Haygood mean by all this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate to think badly of prominent members of the press corps — &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Stuever"&gt;Hank Stuever&lt;/a&gt; is said to be "a regular contributor to the Style section in the Washington Post" and "a two-time finalist for the Pulitzer Prize". But my guess is that these pundits were simply, in the technical sense of the term, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/001903.html"&gt;bullshitting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. More precisely, they were spinning out associative clichés, with no concern for any particular connection to facts.  Their thought process was apparently something like this: Public figures stereotypically avoid taking responsibility, which translates linguistically into passive (&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1246"&gt;"mistakes were made"&lt;/a&gt;) and impersonal third-person (&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1530"&gt;"things happen"&lt;/a&gt;) constructions; Mark Sanford is a public figure; His statement must therefore have avoided the first person and been full of passive constructions. Q.E.D.&lt;/p&gt;

In my discussion, I assumed, for the most part, the most likely clinical scenario, namely that Steve Jobs' insulinoma had metastasized to his liver and that the liver transplant had been done for that indication, but, as some pointed out, it was possible that Jobs had somehow fried his liver without his tumor having metastasized. Unlikely, true, but possible. Unfortunately, news coming out over the last couple of days, while confirming that Jobs did indeed undergo a liver transplant, only shed a little more light on what happened and still leave a lot of questions. For instance, late Tuesday Methodist University Hospital in Memphis &lt;a href="http://www.methodisthealth.org/methodist/About+Us/Newsroom/News/Steve+Jobs+Receives+Liver+Transplant"&gt;issued a press release&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.methodisthealth.org/methodist/Healthcare+Services/Areas+of+Excellence/Transplant+Institute/Meet+The+Care+Team/Surgical+Staff/Eason%2CJames"&gt;James D. Eason, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, program director at Methodist University Hospital Transplant Institute, chief of transplantation and professor of surgery at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center confirmed today, with the patient's permission, that Steve Jobs received a liver transplant at Methodist University Hospital Transplant Institute in partnership with the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in Memphis. 

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Jobs underwent a complete transplant evaluation and was listed for transplantation for an approved indication in accordance with the Transplant Institute policies and United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) policies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He received a liver transplant because he was the patient with the highest MELD score (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease) of his blood type and, therefore, the sickest patient on the waiting list at the time a donor organ became available. Mr. Jobs is now recovering well and has an excellent prognosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this press release leaves as many questions unanswered as it answers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/whats_wrong_with_steve_jobs_yes_jobs_did.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/whats_wrong_with_steve_jobs_yes_jobs_did.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/b4h5TzLhMZk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245945517566"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-6177329154406007609">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ca201a8f93ab92d1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Science" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Science Education" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Blogging about Scientific Meetings</title><published>2009-06-25T15:35:00Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T15:46:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/06/blogging-about-scientific-meetings.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> The question is whether it is legitimate for bloggers to report on what goes on at scientific conferences and meetings.

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are agreed-upon definitions of the word hero, then Joe Albietz must fit many of them. This good-natured, upbeat, intelligent, and skeptical man is a pediatrician who gets up every morning so that he can help — and succeed — in saving the lives of children. I’m proud he’s my friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe’s written &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/609-help-re-establish-the-herd-immunity-of-nevada.html"&gt;a concise and informative article about the JREF’s vaccine drive in Las Vegas for The Amaz!ng Meeting 7&lt;/a&gt;. Vaccinations rates in Vegas were very low due to poverty and a transient population, and their herd immunity to diseases like measles and whooping cough is in serious trouble. Joe came up with the idea of getting donations from the skeptic community to support vaccinations in Vegas, and spearheaded the effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For $25 you can support a child to get a full series of vaccinations. You don’t have to attend &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/37-static/445-the-amazing-meeting-7.html"&gt;TAM 7&lt;/a&gt; or do anything else; just send $25 and a child in Vegas will get protected against a raft of potentially life-threatening diseases. And while those children are getting their vaccinations, we will be at TAM 7 talking about how to fight people like &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/05/19/are-antivaxxers-liable-for-preventable-deaths/"&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/04/26/the-australian-antivax-movement-takes-its-toll/"&gt;Meryl Dorey&lt;/a&gt;, and all the others who are so vocal in making sure that diseases we once stamped out come back with a vengeance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that vaccinations don’t cause autism, and we know they have wiped out smallpox, and put such scourges as polio on the endangered list. Help us, so that we can help others.  &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/609-help-re-establish-the-herd-immunity-of-nevada.html"&gt;Go read Joe’s article&lt;/a&gt; and see how you can easily support this effort.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245943897850"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=13965">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1e1c062032dd9321</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="naming"/><category term="transportation"/><title type="html">The "Bill Golden Gates Bridge"?</title><published>2009-06-25T14:40:55Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T14:40:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/25/the-bill-golden-gates-bridge/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/" type="html">In case you missed it, take a look at this plan for the cash-strapped New York MTA to sell off &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/24/nyregion/24naming.html"&gt;naming rights to subway stations&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Swedish island-province Öland's second-largest silver hoard ever was &lt;a href="http://www.barometern.se/nyheter/oland/skatt-gravdes-fram-i-majsfalt(1394185).gm"&gt;found recently&lt;/a&gt;. Dating from the 11th century and consisting mainly of about 1000 German and English coins, it also has some Islamic ones, one from Sigtuna and even one from India, a very rare occurrence. Some hack silver as well, and a piece of gold rod unless I'm mistaken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The droning noise at the start and end of the above newsreel is a Bronze Age trumpet that had been lying in a bog for almost 2000 years at the time when the hoard was buried and would spend almost another 1000 years there before it was unearthed. Nice try, TV guys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theories have ranged from the most likley…a meteor or comet…all the way to the other side of the spectrum. Regarding this event, a Dr. Ray Stantz was overheard to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have been a participant in the biggest interdimensional cross-rip since the Tunguska blast of 1909!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you familiar with the Tunguska Event?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1908,  an air burst occurred near the Podkamennaya Tunguska River in Russia. Whatever it was, the explosion was equal to about 1000 Hiroshima bombs.  It was not a good day to be a tree when this happened. More than 80 million of them were knocked down over an area of 2150 square km. Hundreds of miles away, windows were broken and people were &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event"&gt;actually&lt;/a&gt; knocked off their feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:335px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://tizona.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/tunguskaartdavis-jpg.jpeg" alt="Artists Conception of event" width="325" height="384"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artist&amp;#39;s Conception of event&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, the IDR theory (Inter-Dimensional Rip) as it was called, was never taken seriously (except by movie screen writers). The comet or asteroid theories however went back and forth as one seemed more plausible than the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it seems that the comet theory may be the real winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090624152941.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for all the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research describes how the exhaust from the shuttle was tracked through the atmosphere. This was similar to Tunguska because if it was caused by a comet, then it too would have injected a lot of water vapor into the atmosphere at very high altitudes. When this happens, noctilucent clouds can be formed that are so high they reflect sunlight to the night-side of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These clouds (or at least very bright nights) were reported in 1908. Recent studies have shown that this water vapor from the shuttle also creates noctilucent clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the bottom-line of the new research but check out the link above to read about the interesting details.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Bob Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245937769257"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=13927">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8fc133b305ee2c89</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="internet madness"/><title type="html">LoJack for iPhones</title><published>2009-06-25T13:39:59Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T13:39:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/25/lojack-for-iphones/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/" type="html">A while back we wrote about &lt;a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/07/lojack-for-laptops-the-free-version/"&gt;Adeona&lt;/a&gt;, a free tracking program that could help police locate and recover a stolen laptop.

&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singh’s statement already has over 10000 signatories, many very distinguished, Sign it now if you haven’t already. And getting on for 600 separate complaints about exaggerated and false claims by chiropractors have been lodged with the General Chiropractic Council and with Trading Standards offices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/freedebate"&gt; &lt;img src="http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/images/sas-libel-2.png" width="180" height="66" alt="free debate" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Click to sign&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCA has exposed the baselessness of most of chiropractic’s claims more effectively than any sceptic could have done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The University of Westminster is seeing the light?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is only recently that the University of Westminster suspended entry to degrees in homeopathy and remedial massage and neuromuscular therapy.  Luckily for science, they have a new Dean who knows bullshit when she sees it.  I suspect than she has been instrumental in starting to restore Westminster’s reputation.  The job isn’t finished yet though.  According to &lt;a href="http://search.ucas.com/cgi-bin/hsrun/search/search/StateId/DznxSo5l-E-1c2C8bLXFFVBCTGQQA-3kKP/HAHTpage/search.HsKeywordSearch.whereNext?query=5382&amp;amp;word=COMPLEMENTARY+MEDICINE"&gt;the UCAS site&lt;/a&gt; Westminster still offers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chinese Medicine: Acupuncture with Foundation (B341)	4FT Hon BSc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health Sciences: Complementary Ther with Foundn (B300)	4FT Hon BSc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health Sciences: Complementary Therapies (B255)	3FT Hon BSc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health Sciences: Herbal Medicine (B342)	3FT Hon BSc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health Sciences: Herbal Medicine with Foundation (B340)	4FT Hon BSc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health Sciences: Naturopathy (B391)	3FT Hon BSc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health Sciences: Naturopathy with Foundation (B392)	4FT Hon BSc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health Sciences: Nutritional Therapy (B400)	3FT Hon BSc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health Sciences: Nutritional Therapy with Foundn (B402)	4FT Hon BSc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the possible exception of herbal medicine, which &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be taught scientifically. all the rest is as delusional as homeopathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rumour has it that Naturopathy may be next for the chop, so it seems appropriate to help the dean by showing a bit more of what the hapless students get taught.  Remember that, according to Westminster, this is a bachelor of &lt;em&gt;science &lt;/em&gt;degree!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychotherapeutic Approaches in Naturopathy 3CMW606&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This module is a core subject for BSc (Hons) Health Sciences: Naturopathy and option for BSc (Hons) Health Sciences: Complementary Therapies; BSc (Hons) Health Sciences: Therapeutic Bodywork; Graduate Diploma in Therapeutic Bodywork.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lectures 3 – 5 of this course are about the Theory and Application of EmoTrance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EMOTRANCE?  No I had never heard of it either. But it takes only two minutes with Google to discover that it yet another product of the enormous navel-gazing self-help industry. A new variant is born almost every day, and no doubt they make buckets of money for their inventors.  You can download a primer from &lt;a href="http://emotrance.com/"&gt;http://emotrance.com/&lt;/a&gt;. The web site announces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“EmoTrance REAL energy healing for the 21st Century”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are three quotations from the primer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;table width="95%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I thought of the lady in the supermarket whose husband had died, and I spend the following time sending her my best wishes, and my best space time quantum healing efforts for her void.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter how “bad”; something is or how old, it is ONLY AN ENERGY and energy can be moved with consciousness in quantum time, easily, and just for the asking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is EmoTrance a Science?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  Yes! But only if you can accept that all living creatures have an energetic/emotional system. Once you make that leap then EmoTrance is completely logical and just makes sense. Like all great discoveries, EmoTrance is simple, natural and you might find you have always been aware of these processes subconsciously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now back to Westminster&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few slides about EmoTrance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/EmoTrance-Day2-s2-vs.jpg" alt="day 2 slide 2"&gt;
  	&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/EmoTrance-Day2-s3-vs.jpg" alt="day 2 slide 3"&gt;
  	&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/EmoTrance-Day2-s13-vs.jpg" alt="day 2 slide 13"&gt;
  	&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/EmoTrance-Day3-s9-vs.jpg" alt="day 3 slide 9"&gt;
  	&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is pure vitalistic psycho-babble.  The usual undefined use of impressive sounding words like “energy” and “quantum” with no defined meaning. Just preposterous made-up gobbledygook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before getting to EmoTrance, the course Psychotherapeutic Approaches in Naturopathy (3CMW606) had a lecture on Flower Essences.  The evidence says, not surprisingly, that the effects of flower essences is not distinguishable from placebo “The hypothesis that flower remedies are associated with effects beyond a placebo response is not supported by data from rigorous clinical trials.” (See Ernst Wien. Klin. Wochenschr. 2002 114(23-24):963-6).  Here are two of the slides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/Flower-essences-lecture1-s19-s.jpg" alt="slide 19" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/Flower-essences-lecture1-s4-s.jpg" alt="slide 4" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last slide departs from the simply silly  to the totally mad.  Dowsing?  Kinesiology? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pendulums&lt;/strong&gt; I’m told from more than one source that the use of pendulums is not uncommon. both in teaching and by students in the Westminster University polyclinic  Apparently they provide an excellent way to choose a ‘remedy’ or make a diagnosis (well, I expect they are as good as the alternatives). If in doubt, guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course pendulums were popular with Cherie Blair &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1456688/Cherie-took-Leo-to-pendulum-healer-in-place-of-MMR-jab.html"&gt;who is reported&lt;/a&gt; to have taken her son Leo to a pendulum waver, &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1454835/Jack-Temple.html"&gt;Jack Temple&lt;/a&gt;, rather than have him vaccinated with MMR.  At least her delusions affected fewer people than those of her husband (the latest &lt;a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.org/"&gt;Iraq body count&lt;/a&gt; is about 100,000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kinesiology&lt;/strong&gt; was originally a word that applied to the perfectly sensible science of human movement.  But &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_kinesiology"&gt;Applied Kinesiology&lt;/a&gt; more often refers now to a fraudulent and totally ineffective diagnostic method invented by (you guessed) a chiropractor.   It has been widely used by alternative medicine to misdiagnose food allergies. It does not work (Garrow, 1988: &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/garrow-kinesiology-bmj-1988.pdf"&gt;download reprint&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Chiropractic Council&lt;/strong&gt;  It is a mind-boggling sign of the incompetence of the General Chiropractic Council that they manage to include kinesiology within their definition of “evidence based care”.  Their definition is clearly sufficiently flexible to include anything whatsoever.  The incompetence of the GCC is documented in superb detail on &lt;a href="http://jdc325.wordpress.com/2009/06/09/incompetence-and-the-general-chiropractic-council/"&gt;jdc325’s blog (James Cole)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence&lt;/strong&gt; (CHRE) is yet another example of the network of ineffective and incompetent quangos that plague us.. It is meant to ensure that regulation is effective but utterly fails to do so. The CHRE is &lt;a href="http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=20&amp;amp;storycode=4122930&amp;amp;c=2"&gt;quoted as saying&lt;/a&gt; “[The GCC] takes its role seriously and aspires to, and often maintains, excellence.”.   Like endorsing kinesiology and ‘craniosacral therapy’ perhaps? Quangos like the CHRE not only fail to ensure regulatory excellence, they actually endorse rubbish. They do more harm than good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reading list for the course includes the following books.  I guess the vibrational medicine (whatever that means) was covered already in the now infamous ‘&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=227"&gt;amethysts emit high yin energy&lt;/a&gt;‘ lectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real magic.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sylvia Hartman’s books seem to feature heavily in the reading list. I just got news of her latest effort&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to a special update to the June 2009 newsletter to announce Silvia Hartmann’s latest book “Magic, Spells &amp;amp; Potions” is now available to pre-order from our site. The eBook edition will be released this Sunday, the most magical day of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because this is a serious book on real magic, potions and fortune telling if you are a beginner Silvia has provided ample sample spells and potions for you to practice working with before you start covering the advanced material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What? No honestly, I didn’t invent that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that stuff of this sort is appropriate for a bachelor of science degree is simply ludicrous.  I have no doubt that Westminster’s new dean can see that as well as anyone else. She has the delicate diplomatic job of extirpating the nonsense,  I wish her well.&lt;/p&gt;

(National Biological Information Infrastructure)  They currently have 78 lessons related to pollination and pollinators listed.&lt;img title="pollinator" src="http://membracid.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/pollinator.jpg?w=150&amp;amp;h=135" alt="pollinator" width="150" height="135"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also have some &lt;a href="http://pollinators.nbii.gov/portal/community/Communities/Ecological_Topics/Pollinators/Learn_About_Pollination/"&gt;fun resources on pollination&lt;/a&gt; and food, like this one: &lt;a href="http://www.pollinator.org/Resources/Chocolate%20and%20Pollinators.pdf"&gt;Chocolate’s Sweet Little Secret (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The cacao flower, while only about the diameter of a nickel, is complex in design and behavior, necessitating a special kind of animal to pollinate it.  Recent studies in cacao plantations indicate that midges, tiny flies that inhabit the damp, shady rain forest, are the only animals that can work their way through the complex cacao flower and pollinate it.  A member of the same insect family as the “no-see-um” flies that plague us  with their bites, this millimeter-long fly is from the family Ceratopogonidae and the genus Forcipomyia–a  very tiny animal with a very long name.  These cacao-pollinating midges are endemic not to plantations, but  to the tropical rain forest itself.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the way in which we grow cacao actually contributes to low pollination rates, since the midges aren’t very happy away from the rain forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy surfing!&lt;/p&gt;

This is not a mystery because of any theoretical problems - it has just been difficult so far, with the technology we have had available, to investigate this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can look at planets around other suns, but so far not with the detail necessary to identify life. This technology is rapidly progressing, however, and so we will likely have tantalizing clues in the coming years, and maybe a definitive answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been listening for intelligent signals from space, but so far have only sampled a tiny fraction of what might be out there. This is also looking for intelligent life only - and perhaps most life is not technology in a way that would lend itself to sending out radio signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best chance we have for finding extraterrestrial life is in our own solar system. Mars is a possible candidate - peharps there are microbes still clinging to existence on that dry cold world. More probes may give us an answer, but some believe we need to put scientists on the surface of Mars to do the kind of sophisticated investigation we would need to really answer the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is Europa, one of the large moons of Jupiter. Europa is covered with ice, and we know it gets hotter toward its core, so it stands to reason that at some depth the ice is liquid water - and where there is liquid water there is at least the potential for life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years another moon has been added to the list of candidates for life - Saturn’s moon Enceladus. It was first observed that plumes of some gas or liquid was being ejected geyser style from the surface of Enceladus, immediately leading to speculation that this was liquid water. Perhaps, then Enceladus is like Europa with a liquid water interior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently astronomers have made this possibility more likely by &lt;a href="http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=CNG.1238a91ad4198d1b19148e150db81cec.5c1&amp;amp;show_article=1"&gt;discovering that the plumes of liquid being ejected from Enceladus contain crystals of salt&lt;/a&gt;.  Salt water is even more likely to harbor life. It has previously been discovered that the plumes contain organic compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, astronomers say, Enceladus has the three ingredients we know are necessary for life - liquid water, organic compounds, and an energy source. The energy source is the tidal forces from Saturn itself - which stretches Enceladus as it orbits its parent planet, heating up its interior. The same is true for the large moons of Jupiter, the innermost of which, Io, is heated up so much by tidal forces that it is literally churning itself inside out with volcanic activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we have at least two candidates in our own solar system for liquid water that may contain life - Europa and Enceladus. This raises the interesting possibility that life in the universe may be more commonly found in such locations than on the surface of planets with atmospheres heated by their proximity to their parent star. Perhaps there are many more opportunities for life in moons orbiting gas giants. Perhaps there is more life living off of tidal friction than solar energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point we can only speculate. That is the frustrating thing about our current state of knowledge of life in the universe - we have an “N” of 1. Until we start discovering life elsewhere we have no way of knowing what is common and what is rare when it comes to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of life elsewhere in our solar system, to me, is no intriguing and potentially important that I think it deserves dedicated missions to investigate further. I would like to see probes to Europa and Enceladus designed specifically to look for life. Perhaps we don’t have the technology yet, but I think its’ something we should start seriously working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we find life on one of these moons and it shares features with life on Earth, that would tell us something very profound about the origin of life. If the life we find is completely different, then we will have a completely separately evolved biochemistry to investigate, and we are also bound to learn a great deal about biology. Either way, the potential for new knowledge is astounding and deserves a high priority.&lt;/p&gt;

In a recently reported study, an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor), &lt;a href="http://www.rxlist.com/celexa-drug.htm"&gt;Celexa&lt;/a&gt;, was shown &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/reducing_repetitive_behaviors_with_meds_not_the_goal"&gt;not to be effective in reducing repetitive behaviors&lt;/a&gt;. Another SSRI, &lt;a href="http://www.rxlist.com/lexapro-drug.htm"&gt;Lexapro&lt;/a&gt;, is to be combined with research on genetics and brain scans in a five-year study (funded with a $9.6 million federal grant). The study seeks to "explore possible mechanisms behind this craving for routine." Geneticist &lt;a href="http://www.psych.uic.edu/faculty/cooke.htm"&gt;Ed Cook&lt;/a&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="http://www.psych.uic.edu/ldn/"&gt;Laboratory of Developmental Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="http://www.psych.uic.edu/"&gt;psychiatry department of the University of Illinois-Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, notes that up to a quarter of individuals on the spectrum have "insistence on sameness." (My son certainly is in that number.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the June 24th &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chicago/chi-autism-research-city-zone-24jun24,0,3324184.story"&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant in the study gets blood drawn for genetic tests, including an analysis of the genes related to serotonin, a neurotransmitter that is part of the brain's system for modulating mood and emotion. Participants' families are asked to donate blood samples so researchers can look for hereditary links. All the blood Cook collects from participants -- he's hoping for more than 250 -- will be shared with a national autism database for other researchers to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants with a high level of insistence on sameness are referred to the group's pharmacologist, &lt;a href="http://www.psych.uic.edu/faculty/owley.htm"&gt;Tom Owley&lt;/a&gt;. The outgoing head of UIC's Neurodevelopmental Psychopharmacology Clinic, Owley conducted a preliminary study two years ago on the antidepressant Lexapro, which affects serotonin levels. Sixty-five percent of participants who took the drug were helped, according to results of a detailed questionnaire completed by their parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/reducing_repetitive_behaviors_with_meds_not_the_goal"&gt;Celexa study&lt;/a&gt; is cited and the &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chicago/chi-autism-research-city-zone-24jun24,0,3324184.story"&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/a&gt; article specifically notes that study. By combining research on Lexapro with genetics and brain scans, it's hoped that researchers can find out why a drug may help some individuals but not others, with a view to developing "medications targeted for people with specific autism symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My son has been taking &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/too_many_meds"&gt;medications&lt;/a&gt; (SSRIs, though not Celexa or Lexapro; antipsychotics; others) since he was 7 years old. We've tried some other medications briefly; two of these---Ritalin and &lt;a href="http://www.rxlist.com/catapres-drug.htm"&gt;Clonidine&lt;/a&gt;---were very unhelpful and, indeed, had something more like deleterious results (as a result of which, Charlie took them only very briefly). My son having very limited speech---and being limited in his ability to identify and describe what he is feeling, physically as well as mentally---he cannot tell us how he feels taking a particular medication. Trying a new one, increasing a dosage, taking him off a medication: The only way we can gauge (guess) how he is feeling is by observing him very closely. And even then, it sometimes (most of the time) not always possible to tell what could be the medication, and what's Charlie reacting to things that have happened around him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie's responses to medications have often not been what what predicted. I still remember the time I gave him an over-the-counter medication---Benadryl---after he'd gotten his arms and legs covered with flea and fly bites at the beach. Maybe it stopped the itching, but, far from getting drowsy, he stayed up past midnight and was very lively (and of course, we had company that night). So finding out ways to determine whether or how an individuals with limited communication might respond to a medication before they take it would be very helpful. [Understatement]  Not that it's that easy to have blood testing or brain scans done for my son---though, lately, he's done very good with &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/thats_ten_years_triumph_in_an_audiology_booth"&gt;various sorts of medical and other testing&lt;/a&gt;---you never know.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org&amp;#39;s Autism Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245917254642"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=3644">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a0c2fb3c9f008c29</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="anti-vaccine lunacy"/><category term="pseudoscience"/><category term="12-step programs"/><category term="Alcoholics Anonymous"/><category term="Bill W"/><category term="Jenny McCarthy"/><title type="html">At long last, I agree with ‘Age of Autism’ about something</title><published>2009-06-25T07:13:59Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T07:13:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/06/25/at-long-last-i-agree-with-age-of-autism-about-something/" type="text/html"/><media:group><media:content url="http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/84ccd467894d8e454d689effc211d515?s=96&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G"/></media:group><media:group><media:content url="http://img.youtube.com/vi/KnkyZ5uOScI/2.jpg"/></media:group><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent blog, the anti-vaccinationists over at &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/06/jenny-mccarthy-is-the-new-bill-w.html"&gt;Age of Autism compared Jenny McCarthy to Bill W. of Alcoholics Anonymous fame&lt;/a&gt;.

In the 12-year period shown, 19% remain after 30 days, 10% remain after 90 days, and 5% remain after a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The retention rate of AA is 5% after one year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;60% of those surveyed were getting outside professional help. This means that any success (or failure) rate, however it is defined, can’t be attributed entirely to AA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An extensive study (Hester and Miller, Handbook of alcoholism treatment approaches) shows that peer-based 12-step alcohol treatment programs do NOT have a higher success rate than no treatment at all. Facilitated 12-step treatment (trained facilitators guiding subjects through the twelve-step process) were marginally better. “The two tests of AA found it inferior to other treatments or even no treatment but were not sufficient to rank AA reliably.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brief, non-confrontational interventions and motivational interviewing were found most effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/06/25/at-long-last-i-agree-with-age-of-autism-about-something/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/KnkyZ5uOScI/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, it’s not my comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Chase survived in part because hundreds of people prayed to Father Emil Kapaun to intercede on his behalf. It was absolutely a miracle.” — Paula Kear, Chase’s mother&lt;/em&gt;People in Colwich like to touch Chase Kear’s arm or his shoulder with their fingers. Or they hug him. “Miracle Man,” they say. “Let me touch the miracle.” With anybody else in Colwich, this would be just talk. But it’s not just talk to the Vatican.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among people that Ambrosi will consult on Friday will be Chase’s neurosurgeon, Raymond Grundmeyer, who said in a brief e-mail last week that he considers Chase’s survival a miracle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psst, Chase’s family. Here’s your chance to ask then for your money back, since the neurosurgeon says he didn’t do anything. Hell, with such miraculous healings, who needs neurosurgeons at all? Maybe we should all just declare:  God is my neurosurgeon! Of course this is absurd. I don’t know the details of the case, but a person surviving a terrible accident after being treated medically makes for a pretty low-grade miracle to me. Wake me up when god does something unambiguous like healing an amputee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;li&gt;60% of them go to church only for weddings/christenings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;60% of them don’t think religious studies should be compulsory in schools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;59% of them think that religion “has a negative influence on the world”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;55% of them are not bothered about religion (&lt;em&gt;Hemant adds: This means they’re essentially apathetic about religion.  Thanks, commenters!&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;50% of them have never prayed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;41% believe nothing happens to your body when you die&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30% of them (&lt;em&gt;only 30%!&lt;/em&gt;) believe in an afterlife&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;16% have never been to church&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10% of them (&lt;em&gt;only 10%!&lt;/em&gt;) think they will be reincarnated as an animal/human&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is the case, then &lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-8928-Philadelphia-Atheism-Examiner~y2009m6d24-Two-thirds-of-teenagers-dont-believe-in-God"&gt;this provides even more evidence against a common religious claim&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So many Christian Evangelicals here in America claim that without there god there can be no morality. If that view held true, than we should expect to see these British teens to be self-absorbed brats who only care about themselves. However, the survey discovered the opposite to be the case. 90 percent of those surveyed believe that they should treat other people better than they treat themselves, trumping the “Golden Rule.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I made small fun of FoxNews, which caused a few commenters to accuse me of hypocrisy and being a “lib,” whatever that is. Some went so far as to suggest that I and the JREF had a deeply liberal agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To quote Sherman T. Potter: horse hockey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, to be clear, the JREF has no political stance whatsoever. We will criticize those that ignore scientific inquiry and praise those who embrace it, regardless of party. As a non-profit, we’re not permitted to endorse particular candidates or parties, and we have not done so. In the past few weeks, I have been critical of many media sources, including MSNBC, ABCNews, and yes, FoxNews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone investigating my personal political contributions on the Internet, will discover that I donated money to the campaign of Hal Bidlack, a friend of mine for some years now. I gave him a donation because I know him to be a man of honor, and I feel there are far too few of them in our government. I would have donated the money to his campaign regardless of his party, though he happens to be a Democrat. When I lived in Virginia, I registered as a Republican to support the campaign of James Burton, another man I believe would improve our government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a political independent, and I don’t know what party affiliations other JREF employees have, if any. I vote based on the issues of the day, and I care not for party. That disclosed, I have a more important message to convey: &lt;strong&gt;skepticism is not compatible with politics&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>jeff@randi.org (Jeff Wagg)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245911680910"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d31594f71348f136</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><title type="html">Command Performance</title><published>2009-06-25T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/military/celebrities/edmcmahon.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Was sidekick Ed McMahon once Johnny Carson's commanding officer?</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245908657277"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1538">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dcb451f9b2bee794</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Books"/><category term="Morphology"/><category term="Words words words"/><title type="html">Slang affixation: it's all mystery-y-ish-y</title><published>2009-06-25T05:42:26Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T05:42:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1538" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195314638?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=thevisualthes-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0195314638"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/~bgzimmer/slang.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;If you haven't picked up a copy of Michael Adams' new book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195314638?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=thevisualthes-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0195314638"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slang: The People's Poetry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, well, what are you waiting for? For starters, it's a lively and engaging look at English slang and its multitudinous forms. At the same time, it's a thoughtful interrogation of what "slang" actually is, and how we might determine its boundaries. One way that Michael expands traditional notions of slang is in his treatment of affixation, or what he amusingly calls "unorthodox lexifabricology." I talked to Michael about slangy affixation in the &lt;a href="http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/dictionary/1898/"&gt;second part&lt;/a&gt; of my two-part interview with him for the &lt;a href="http://www.visualthesaurus.com/"&gt;Visual Thesaurus&lt;/a&gt;. An excerpt follows below.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;VT:&lt;/b&gt; In your book, you have a whole section on slangy  affixes (prefixes, suffixes, and infixes). This is lexical  material that is not easily made into a dictionary entry, necessarily. For instance, there's the &lt;em&gt;-iz-&lt;/em&gt; infix (&lt;em&gt;hizzouse&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;house&lt;/em&gt;) and the &lt;em&gt;-diddly-&lt;/em&gt; infix (&lt;em&gt;scrum-diddly-umptious&lt;/em&gt;).  Is your  goal there to show that the &amp;quot;poetic&amp;quot;  productivity of  slang can work on a sort of sub-lexical level?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;MA:&lt;/b&gt;  In a way, I think it's both sub-lexical  and super-lexical. The  very practice of using  infixes like that can be slangy, so that's super-lexical. The same is true with  suffixes like &lt;em&gt;-y&lt;/em&gt;. The slanginess comes out  of the suffixing as much as it comes out of a particular suffix that you would  define.  But it's also true that because  those structures are so flexible and they can be used so readily on the fly or in the moment, it's easy for people to use them to come up with &lt;a href="http://www.visualthesaurus.com/?w=nonce%20word"&gt;nonce words&lt;/a&gt;. They're infinitely productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that I  argued in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195175999?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=thevisualthes-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0195175999"&gt;Slayer Slang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and argue again in this book is that we think that there are constraints on these suffixes, but there  really aren't.  Always, eventually, we  figure out a way to get outside of those constraints, so that we can make up  new words. You'd think if you were  looking historically at the language, you'd say, "Well, you can see what some of  the rules applying to &lt;em&gt;-y &lt;/em&gt;suffixing are.   You can't add the &lt;em&gt;-y&lt;/em&gt; suffix to a seven-syllable word."  But you can, if somebody decides to do  it.  And in some situation where that  could be a slang opportunity,  it's not just that  somebody could do it, somebody &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; do it. We just won't know about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;VT:&lt;/b&gt; Or we'll know about it if we  Google for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;MA:&lt;/b&gt; Well, exactly, and as I say in the  book,  one of my most astonishing adventures over the last several  years has been just plugging these in, really just saying, &amp;quot;Now surely, this can&amp;#39;t take the -&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;  suffix,&amp;quot; and then finding out about fifty percent of the time that it can. Fifty percent of the time it doesn&amp;#39;t, but  there&amp;#39;s no natural reason that the words that I tested that haven&amp;#39;t appeared  with a &lt;em&gt;-y&lt;/em&gt; suffix yet couldn't take that &lt;em&gt;-y&lt;/em&gt; suffix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Read the rest &lt;a href="http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/dictionary/1898/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no better proof of Michael's contention about the productivity of the &lt;em&gt;-y&lt;/em&gt; suffix than a recent &lt;a href="http://blog.oup.com/2009/05/y-suffix-bananas/"&gt;OUPblog post&lt;/a&gt; by Mark Peters, whose &lt;a href="http://wordlust.blogspot.com/"&gt;Wordlustitude&lt;/a&gt; blog is a never-ending morpholicious nonce-word-athon. You might think that &lt;em&gt;-y&lt;/em&gt; would resist suffixation on words already ending with the /i/ vowel, but you would be wrong. Mark has found a ton of "double-y" words in the wild, like &lt;i&gt;jealousy-y&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;technology-y&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;secret identity-y&lt;/i&gt;. The nonce formation that takes the cake, though, is &lt;i&gt;mystery-y-ish-y&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;My faith tells me that marital sex, like all acts blessed with holiness, is a great mystery — and from thence comes its beauty.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Well, it WOULD be wouldn’t it? Since Dawn’s not married, she can’t be having marital sex. It’s all mystery-y-ish-y. And she can imagine it’s pretty, if she wants.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Mark writes, &amp;quot;After years of weird-word collecting, I&amp;#39;m pretty unfazed by words with multiple, redundant, exuberant suffixes… However, even I was gobsmacked out of my chair when I spotted &lt;em&gt;mystery-y-ish-y&lt;/em&gt;." Indeed, the mystery-y-ish-iness of English word formation never ceases to amaze.&lt;/p&gt;

Specifically, I commented about how he is not only undergoing the chemotherapy ordered by his doctors. As you may recall, Hauser is a 13-year-old boy who, after being diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma and undergoing one round of chemotherapy, refused to undergo any more. His mother supported him, and ultimately a judge had to order Daniel's parents to make sure that he underwent standard therapy for his very curable form of cancer. Daniel's mother Colleen took off with him shortly afterward, rumored to be heading for Tijuana. Ultimately, Colleen Hauser turned herself and Daniel in, and Daniel started chemotherapy. What provoked my post was how Daniel's tumor was shrinking in response to chemotherapy after having grown while he was off chemotherapy and relying on quackery, specifically Daniel and his family's reaction. Consistent with the behavior of woo fans everywhere, Daniel and his family didn't attribute his tumor's response to the chemotherapy, but rather to the vitamins and other stuff in various "alternative" concoctions Daniel was taking in addition to chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, it's so predictable that woo-fans who "integrate" quackery with their conventional science-based medical therapy almost invariably attribute any good that happens to the woo and any complications to the conventional medicine, that I'm half tempted to call it a law and come up with a name for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be that as it may, there was also a court hearing for an update on Daniel's condition in which Daniel's parents requested that the court rescind the child protection order governing Daniel's medical care and giving Judge John Rodenberg jurisdiction over his care. Given that the last time Judge Rodenberg gave the Hausers too much leeway Colleen Hauser bolted and ran with Daniel to keep him from chemotherapy, the judge's ruling was &lt;a href="http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/health/48911802.html?elr=KArksUUUoDEy3LGDiO7aiU"&gt;about what you would expect&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/update_daniel_hauser_must_continue_chemo.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/update_daniel_hauser_must_continue_chemo.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/7t8S12KtjlI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245905051494"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1537">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/69e56b20d4a0b31e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Language and politics"/><title type="html">The biggest self of self is indeed self</title><published>2009-06-25T04:15:43Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T04:15:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1537" type="text/html"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Sanford1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="408764"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Sanford1a.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="45453"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Gov. Mark Sanford, back &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1526"&gt;in pocket&lt;/a&gt;, explained himself (from the NYT &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/24/us/24text-sanford.html"&gt;transcript&lt;/a&gt; of his &lt;a href="http://video.nytimes.com/video/2009/06/24/us/1194841154720/gov-mark-sanford-admits-affair.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;I'm here because if you were to look at God's laws, they're in every instance designed to protect people from themselves. I think that that is the bottom line of God's law, that it's not a moral, rigid list of do's and don'ts just for the heck of do's and don'ts. It is indeed to protect us from ourselves. And the biggest self of self is, indeed, self; that sin is, in fact, grounded in this notion of what is it that I want as opposed to somebody else?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assertion that "the biggest self of self is indeed self" makes a poetic sort of psychological and theological sense, I think, though I'm not quite sure how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought this might be a (perhaps garbled) quotation or allusion of some sort. But I doubt that the governor is familiar with Gerard Manley Hopkins' unfinished fragment &lt;em&gt;On the Portrait of Two Beautiful Young People&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;21   There's none but good can bé good, both for you&lt;br&gt;
22   And what sways with you, maybe this sweet maid;&lt;br&gt;
23   None good but God—a warning wavèd to&lt;br&gt;
24   One once that was found wanting when Good weighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;25   Man lives that list, that leaning in the will&lt;br&gt;
26   No wisdom can forecast by gauge or guess,&lt;br&gt;
27   The selfless self of self, most strange, most still,&lt;br&gt;
28   Fast furled and all foredrawn to No or Yes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;29   Your feast of; that most in you earnest eye&lt;br&gt;
30   May but call on your banes to more carouse.&lt;br&gt;
31   Worst will the best. What worm was here, we cry,&lt;br&gt;
32   To have havoc-pocked so, see, the hung-heavenward boughs?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;33   Enough: corruption was the world's first woe.&lt;br&gt;
34   What need I strain my heart beyond my ken?&lt;br&gt;
35   O but I bear my burning witness though&lt;br&gt;
36   Against the wild and wanton work of men.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Poser suggests that "the biggest self of self is self" might be a bad translation of some Sanskrit scripture; but if so, I haven't been able to locate the original. And in any case, that seems even further from Sanford's style than Hopkins is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audio for the whole passage is here: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a more careful transcript:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:smaller;color:#ff0000"&gt;But I'm- I'm- I'm here&lt;br&gt;
because if you were to look at God's laws&lt;br&gt;
uh they're in every instance designed to protect people from themselves&lt;br&gt;
um I think that that is the bottom line of God's law&lt;br&gt;
that it's not a- a- a- a moral r- rigid list of dos and don'ts just for the heck of dos and donts&lt;br&gt;
it is indeed to protect us&lt;br&gt;
from ourselves and the biggest&lt;br&gt;
self of self is&lt;br&gt;
is- is in- indeed self&lt;br&gt;
that sin is in fact grounded in this notion&lt;br&gt;
of what is it that I want&lt;br&gt;
as opposed to somebody else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see only one problem with the NYT transcript: the question mark at the end is inappropriate, since the what-clause, despite the subject-aux inversion, is not a direct question, but rather the complement of &lt;em&gt;notion of&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a lot is left out of a transcript. In this case, the performance of the phrase &amp;quot;the biggest self of self is indeed self&amp;quot; — especially the internal pausing — is consistent with the idea that the governor had something less poetic in mind, for example &amp;quot;the biggest danger to self is indeed self&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;the biggest danger to ourselves is indeed ourselves&amp;quot;. Or maybe &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1245"&gt;We have met the enemy, and he is us&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cited phrase by itself is here: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update — following a &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1537#comment-34600"&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; with misterfricative in the comments below, I suggest that Gov. Sanford had in mind a phrase like "the biggest source of sin is indeed self", and then performed a rare double-anticipation speech error. ]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My vote for the best comment on the whole Sanford saga goes to the lolcat version &lt;a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/2009/06/24/todays-lolcat-picture-dedicated-to-south-carolina-governor-mark-sanford/"&gt;offered by John Scalzi&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/SanfordLolcat.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[But then, maybe &lt;a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2009/06/25/the-self-of-self/#comment-280624"&gt;the poem contributed by Salient&lt;/a&gt; at Crooked Timber is even better:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;The biggest self of self is self:&lt;br&gt;

As usual, I tend to be open to trying new technologies, but don’t like being at the bleeding edge (where people get hurt).  There’s no doubt that electronic reading devices have a long way to go, but there’s also little doubt that they’re the wave of the future, or at least a sizable part of it.  And the technology seems to have reached a point where Kindle editions of books are a non-trivial part of the market.  My own decision to get one was definitely influenced by the number of queries I received about whether my own book would have a Kindle edition.  (Answer:  yes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now it’s arrived!  So the question is:  what’s the first book I should buy?  An obvious choice would be &lt;em&gt;Infinite Jest&lt;/em&gt;, as the &lt;a href="http://infinitesummer.org/"&gt;Infinite Summer&lt;/a&gt; project is underway and (as I have learned) toting a thousand-page book around on a cross-country flight is less than perfectly convenient.  But, of course, I already own that book.  And, as &lt;a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/06/infinite-pagination.php"&gt;Matthew Yglesias points out&lt;/a&gt;, you don’t want to buy Kindle versions of impressive books that you can prominently display to buff up your credentials as a person of culture.  And the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; would be to display a giant, impressive book on your shelves, but one that was clearly unread and in pristine condition, even though you really did read it, only you read it on your Kindle.  Worst of all possible worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea, then, is to find a good book that I haven’t yet read, but not one that is &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; good — not good enough that I’d rather have the dead-tree edition.

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;47. With regard to NAMA, risk-sharing structures should be considered to address the well-known pricing problem. The pricing of distressed assets is complex and can slow down the transfer of assets from the troubled bank. Risk-sharing can potentially create better incentives for managing the bad assets. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;And they also guard against the risk that the taxpayer does not bear a disproportionate burden of the costs cleaning up the banks.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;[emphasis added]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breffni O'Rourke, who sent in this example of &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/index.php?s=overnegation"&gt;overnegation&lt;/a&gt;, comments that "My fear is that they actually mean exactly what they say."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A phrase of the form "the risk that X" suggests that X is possible but not certain, and would be a Bad Thing. Some &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=%22the+risk+that%22&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;aqi="&gt;examples from the web&lt;/a&gt; where X is a positive statement (X in bold):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;… the risk that &lt;strong&gt;a hidden asteroid in a stealth-path will hit the earth&lt;/strong&gt;…&lt;br&gt;
The risk that &lt;strong&gt;HIV-seropositive drug users (DUs) transmit their HIV-infection&lt;/strong&gt;…&lt;br&gt;
… the Risk that &lt;strong&gt;Hatchery Enhancement Will Reduce Genetic Diversity of White Seabass&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
… the risk that &lt;strong&gt;mass killings occur&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
… the risk that &lt;strong&gt;a child will develop diabetes&lt;/strong&gt; …&lt;br&gt;
… the risk that &lt;strong&gt;I will have a major complication after my valve operation&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=%22the+risk+that+*+not%22&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;aqi="&gt;examples where X contains a negation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;… the risk that &lt;strong&gt;acquisitions might not be integrated successfully&lt;/strong&gt; …&lt;br&gt;
… the risk that &lt;strong&gt;she might not be able to carry a future pregnancy to term&lt;/strong&gt; …&lt;br&gt;
… the risk that &lt;strong&gt;Adolor may not receive regulatory approval of Entereg (alvimopan)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
… the risk that &lt;strong&gt;DHS is not creating the institutional knowledge needed&lt;/strong&gt; …&lt;br&gt;
… the risk that &lt;strong&gt;Glu may not launch the mobile game as scheduled&lt;/strong&gt; …&lt;br&gt;
… the risk that &lt;strong&gt;there's not enough binder in the paint for it to stick&lt;/strong&gt; …&lt;/span&gt; …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether positive or negative, X is something that the writer hopes to avoid. So when the IMF staffers write about "&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;the risk that &lt;strong&gt;the taxpayer does not bear a disproportionate burden&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;", it's easy to see why Breffni is concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

Manifested Glory removed the video, but as the Scientologists have learned, nothing stays dead on the Internet. Here’s the news report, complete with clips from the original video.&lt;/p&gt;

If you&amp;#39;ve got a little time — there is a bit of tl;dr about it all — read &lt;a href="http://www.reasonproject.org/archive/item/debate_001_sam_harris_v_philip_ball3/"&gt;Sam Harris's exchanges with Philip Ball&lt;/a&gt;. Sam Harris we all know; Ball is a very reputable science writer who is also very much one of those &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m an atheist, but…&amp;quot; fellows. It&amp;#39;s an infuriating conversation because, as usual, rather than talking about what us &amp;quot;New Atheists&amp;quot; actually think, Harris has to constantly go back and address the blithe misconceptions of the accommodationist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Harris's conclusion in particular is worth reading anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I realize that my tone of chastisement has probably grown very tedious and could be mistaken for hostility. But I can't help but feel that there is a great asymmetry between our points of view - both in how fully they have been thought out and in their degree of the moral seriousness. I see the perpetuation of ancient tribalism and ignorance (read "religion") to be a grave problem, and the source of much unnecessary suffering in the world; you claim that the problem is either not very serious or that it is unavoidable--in either case there is not much to be done. You do not seem to see what an astonishing number of the world's conflicts and missed opportunities arise from people's false knowledge about God, and when specific instances are pointed out to you, you deem them to be inevitable (if it's not religion it would be something else), or you defensively say, well of course I object to that instance of religious stupidity: parents shouldn't withhold blood transfusions from their children!... But the truth is, a comprehensive response to the problem of religious ignorance is possible, and a piecemeal response is totally unprincipled and bound to seem so. Our world has be shattered, and is reliably shattered anew with each subsequent generation, by irreconcilable claims about God and his magic books. Until we stop enabling these competing delusions--by our silence and by our silly attempts to change the subject--we will have no one to blame but ourselves when medieval ideas come crashing into public life--as they do, and will, to our great detriment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a weird thing to argue with an atheist who claims religion is unavoidable (Oh? So what's so special about &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;?) and isn't that bad or is actually beneficial (So why aren't you going to church for your health?), but they're out there and they are irritatingly inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there's the mischaracterization of outspoken atheists and the apparent contempt for theistic scientists. Here's &lt;a href="http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/religionandtheology/1433/the_two_faces_of_new_atheism_/"&gt;another example of that attitude&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should not overlook the New Atheists' support for science, progressive views and legitimization of non-belief as a viable alternative. Unfortunately, their record is also marked by an intolerance of religious people and the alienation of potential progressive allies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That always baffles me. So if I say that I'm proud to be an atheist, I think theism is a profound fallacy that is incompatible with scientific thinking, that's &lt;i&gt;intolerance&lt;/i&gt; and then these religious allies are going to get pissy and decide evolution isn't worth defending anymore? That's an awfully broad interpretation of intolerance, and an extraordinarily dismissive opinion of the theistic evolutionists. I guarantee you that no matter how &lt;i&gt;rude&lt;/i&gt; a New Atheist might be to religion, Ken Miller will never give up on teaching evolution or trying to explain science to creationists. The accommodationists can stop trying to scare us into silence with these goofy, unrealistic threats.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.case.edu/singham/2009/06/24/the_new_atheists_vs_the_accommodationists"&gt;Mano Singham makes a similar point&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The accommodationists argue that it is a mistake to insist that science is antithetical to religion because if science is determined to be an intrinsically atheistic enterprise, then even so-called moderate religionists will turn away from science and not support efforts to oppose the teaching of religious ideas such as intelligent design in science classes. This kind of mistaken solicitousness for the sensitivities of religious people, the fear that they will take their ball and go home if others are mean to them, is not new. During the run up to the Scopes Monkey trial in 1925, there were many accommodationists of that era who did not want Clarence Darrow to defend Scopes because they felt that his scorn for religious beliefs would alienate potential religious allies. We now view Darrow's performance in that trial as one of the high points in opposing the imposition of religious indoctrination in public schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no downside to godless vigor. Nobody has come up with a reason yet why we should sit down and shut up.&lt;/p&gt;

Details are sketchy, but it's safe to say in the world of 9, something has gone horribly wrong, the world has been destroyed, and the only survivors are some &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi3871736601/"&gt;cute little sack people and an army of murderous machines&lt;/a&gt;.  One can't help but think that a few squiddies from the Matrix somehow tunnelled into Little Big Planet.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it tickles my fancy, if only because it checks the requisite boxes of "post apocalyptic dystopia" and "technopunk machinery".  Which is good, because some of the people behind the film have been nice enough to send me these &lt;em&gt;ludicrously&lt;/em&gt; high res images of the Fabricator, a factory robot with misfiring synapses that has been building the war machines.  Click on the pictures below for full size images - they really are massive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the beast!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above image is a down scaled crop from this texture plan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underneath the texturing are the bones of the machine, as lovingly illustrated in this artwork:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just a detail from the above graphic, and yet it's big enough that I could make it into a desktop wallpaper, just for you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencepunk.com/v5/gallery/9/fabmachine_wallpaper_l.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/upload/2009/06/first_look_at_the_machines_of/fabmachine_wallpaper_s.png" width="500" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've also been given an exclusive piece of artwork showing 3 and 4, two of the small "stitch punks" at the centre of the film's plot.  The PR bumf says:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Communicating visually, not verbally, 3 and 4 are the scholarly twins who voraciously catalogue everything they can see and find, recording and building a massive database for the group of the world that surrounds them and the history that led up to their creation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To which producer Tim Burton adds:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"3 and 4 go back to &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IQcMeNh7Hc"&gt;the original experience&lt;/a&gt; of non-speaking characters. I think it works for them, it makes them different from the others, and I can relate to those characters because I didn't speak when I was a child either."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Err, okay Tim. Anyway, click on the below image to see the full artwork.  It will be available as a collectible card, my sources tell me that San Diego's Comic-Con 09 would be a good place to start looking for them, if you're into that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several specific initiatives were mentioned in the press release, such as more section 8 (housing) vouchers, better interagency communication, and increased funding to independent living centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all moves in the right direction, yes.  But conspicuously absent (still) in the press release is any mention of the core issue of institutional bias in the health care system and the need for significant &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/words_or_lack_thereof_from_obama_and_harkin_on_cca"&gt;health care reform&lt;/a&gt; in order to actually realize Olmstead.  It's continuing, to me anyway, to be very hard to believe that the administration is truly "getting it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that may not be very obvious to policy makers is that many of us who rely on "the system" have been lied to and let down so many times now that to eliminate something we care deeply about from all discussion ends up feeling like "&lt;a href="http://www.usingenglish.com/reference/idioms/last+straw.html"&gt;the last straw&lt;/a&gt;."  The first time a promise is broken, OK, stuff happens, and there are complex issues at play always.  But for many of us this is just one more thing in a long line of being ignored and neglected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to see some more aggressive action on core issues in health care reform--time for the administration to "&lt;a href="http://www.usingenglish.com/reference/idioms/put+your+money+where+your+mouth+is.html"&gt;put the money where its mouth is&lt;/a&gt;."  Else, "The Year of Community Living" is just another broken promise and more "&lt;a href="http://www.usingenglish.com/reference/idioms/salt+in+a+wound.html"&gt;salt in the wound&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Apologies for all the American idioms, but they all seemed &lt;a href="http://www.usingenglish.com/reference/idioms/lip+service.html"&gt;unusually appropriate&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org&amp;#39;s Autism Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245886650098"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=541">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0d744693f1d88cda</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><title type="html">The death and rebirth of vitalism</title><published>2009-06-24T23:02:31Z</published><updated>2009-06-24T23:02:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=541" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the common themes in biology and medicine is the feeling that somehow there must be &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt;.  Creationist cults simply &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that life must be more than matter, and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/12/smackdown_please.php"&gt;mind-body dualists&lt;/a&gt; (which includes most alternative medicine advocates) are &lt;em&gt;certain&lt;/em&gt; that humans are more than an “ugly bag of mostly water” (sorry for the geek reference).  If you can stick with me here, I’ll explain to you a bit of the history surrounding this fallacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us intuitively feel that we are both a body and a person.  In every day life, it makes a certain operational sense to think of our “mind” as being something distinct.  From a biological standpoint, however, this doesn’t work as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biology was one of the last of the “natural philosophies” to become a science.  It was clear to those who studied chemistry and physics that certain principles seemed to explain the natural world, but those who studied living things were mostly involved in description.  Still, biology has become a science in its own right. &lt;a href="http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e01_2/autonomy.htm"&gt;According to Ernst Mayr&lt;/a&gt;, one of the greatest biologists of the last century, a number of events preceded biology being recognized as a legitimate science.  One vital event was the recognition that all biological processes were constrained by the laws of physics and chemistry.  Another important step was the rejection of two erroneous principles: &lt;em&gt;vitalism&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;teleology&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teleology &lt;/strong&gt;is the idea that there is some larger end-point or goal that drives biological processes, such as the idea of the ladder of ascent where the development of life has had, as its goal, the creation of more and more complex forms.  Darwin’s synthesis of natural selection and evolution pretty much destroyed this idea.  Clearly, if stochastic processes can drive the changes we see in living beings, determinism is out the door.  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/2008/06/evolving_without_gods_permissi.php"&gt;Evolution has elements that are random (changes in environment, mutations, etc.) but other elements that are decidedly non-random&lt;/a&gt; (for example, convergent adaptations are difficult to call “random”—sure the processes that underlie them are random, but these processes and pressures lead to a non-random result).  But from a “cosmic” standpoint, there is no room left for teleologic explanations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More offensive to me as a physician is the idea of &lt;em&gt;vitalism&lt;/em&gt;.  This ancient principle says that the difference between living and non-living things is some sort of non-material vital force.  As the natural philosophers of the last few centuries became more sophisticated, they worked with this assumption and tried to define it scientifically.  For example, it was felt that organic and inorganic matter differed in that, if melted with heat, only inorganic matter could re-crystalize naturally with the removal of the heat source (since we obviously cannot add that essential vital force).  This seemed to give a “scientific” way of testing whether or not something was from a “living” source.   If this were found to be true, it might pave the way for more experiments that could help show that there must be some sort of “elan vital” that animates living matter.  &lt;a href="http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowPDF&amp;amp;ProduktNr=223979&amp;amp;Ausgabe=225203&amp;amp;ArtikelNr=13463&amp;amp;filename=13463.pdf"&gt;In 1828, a chemist named Friedrich Wohler synthesized urea&lt;/a&gt;, an organic compound, from two inorganic compounds.  In other words, he created “life” from “non-life”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, and experiments like it, effectively destroyed the best attempt to use knowledge of natural laws to divide living from non-living systems. The implications were probably unimportant to Wohler and many others, but from a modern perspective, this is seen as the beginning of the end for vitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The death of vitalism, and the discovery of genetics, allowed biology to grow into a mature scientific discipline.  There are no processes in biology that have not been amenable to scientific investigation or that have required a &lt;em&gt;deus ex machina&lt;/em&gt; to fully understand.  That doesn’t mean that vitalism is dead.  Since we, as human beings, operationally see ourselves and both “mind” and “body”, we will always be tempted to think vitalistically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is especially true in the most anthropocentric of sciences, medicine.  All alternative medicine is based on the idea that we are more than biology, that there is some force, some &lt;em&gt;elan vital&lt;/em&gt; that animates us and elevates us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chiropractic uses the concept of “vertebral subluxation complexes” that block the flow of vital energy, despite the lack of any evidence for these things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acupuncture, &lt;em&gt;reiki&lt;/em&gt;, and other “energy therapies” claim to affect the role of &lt;em&gt;qi&lt;/em&gt;, or vital energy, a non-organic, immeasurable  force that animates us.  Such a vital force has never been found.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Homeopathy makes claims that some sort of magic happens to water when they shake it just right.  In this case, it’s actually the water that has some sort of vital force imposed upon it, but then this magic water is supposed to be able to affect human biology via a presumably equally invisible and immeasurable process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If something is immeasurable and un-observable, either directly or indirectly, then it is not medically relevant.  Remember, if you are claiming that an intervention is helping a patient, then you are claiming that it is measurable and observable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a measurable, observable phenomenon is better explained by known physical laws than by a vitalistic explanation, then why make up a silly, non-reality-based explanation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitalism, an ancient and discredited philosophy, has become irrelevant in modern thinking with two important exceptions: alternative medicine, and religion.  That, right there, should tell you something important.&lt;/p&gt;

This week, in &lt;a href="http://www.colorado.edu/news/r/b31ca2928f7cb0fba7aa3341ff400e16.html"&gt;a University of Colorado study&lt;/a&gt; of the geysers spewing from Enceladus, astronomers found the water lacked sodium. They observed it using the 10 meter Keck and 4 meter Anglo Australian ground-based telescopes, and detected very little if any sodium in the geysers. If the plumes originated from an undersurface ocean then they are expected to have sodium in them. Instead, given the unsalty nature of the geysers, they surmise there may be pockets of liquid water under the surface which evaporates into space, or it could be from crustal plates of surface ice rubbing against each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2005, the Cassini space probe orbiting Saturn surprised astronomers when it detected geysers of water spewing from the icy moon Enceladus. This week, &lt;a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/newsreleases/newsrelease20090624/"&gt;in a JPL and Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics study&lt;/a&gt; of the outermost ring of Saturn, astronomers found the ring particles contained sodium. They observed it using the Cassini spacecraft, and detected sodium salts in the rings. This ring is known to be replenished by Enceladus’s geysers.  If the plumes originated from an undersurface ocean then they are expected to have sodium in them. Given the salty nature of the rings, they surmise there must be a global ocean under the surface which shoots water into space where it replenished that ring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr width="40%"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uh, say what? Which is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beats me. I’m a violent star-explodey kind of guy, not an exooceanologist. I imagine the authors of the two papers have their opinions on both studies, and I’d love to hear what they have to say. I’d also like to see the spectra obtained by the no-salt-in-the-plumes team first (because a non-detection of something is always on shakier ground than a positive detection of something) before I would come to any conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But thus is science. Two observations, two good teams, two very different conclusions. That’s what it’s like on the cutting edge… and we’ll need more observations to cut through all this. Happily, as Cassini orbits the Saturn system it will be passing directly through the plumes at least twice more, giving astronomers that many more chances to see what’s happening on that tiny little moon so far away. &lt;/p&gt;

Two different worlds: That's what services for children on the autism spectrum and services for adults on the autism spectrum are like, according to Shawn Lattanzio, Montgomery County's program manager of a Maryland initiative to help autistic students transition to adulthood. Today's &lt;a href="http://www.gazette.net/stories/06242009/poolnew181200_32541.shtml"&gt;Gazette.net&lt;/a&gt; highlights some of the post-school issues adults with disabilities face. Families are in "shock" when school services end and they see what programs for adults are like compared to that for children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outlook can be grim, advocates and officials say. The waiting list for housing and other state services can be decades long. Doctors oftentimes balk at accepting Medicaid. Jobs are scarcer than for non-disabled people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several county and state agencies partner to make that transition as seamless as possible for the more than 5,500 students in Montgomery County between the ages of 14 and 21. The state gives priority to people in their first year out of school. The state's "New Directions" program, launched in 2005, lets parents decide how to spend their children's funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All but a few of the graduates will receive day service and possibly supported employment, Lattanzio said. The state pays for a fraction of the therapies, behavioral management and family supports that most had while in school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anchor that can steady the transition most is finding meaningful employment, advocates and parents say. But less than half of developmentally disabled adults in Maryland had jobs last year, according to a November report by Cornell University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there are programs and plans to help with the transition. But the recurring problem is that there just aren't enough programs and, indeed, &lt;em&gt;jobs&lt;/em&gt; for adults to transition into. &lt;a href="http://www.gazette.net/stories/06242009/poolnew181200_32541.shtml"&gt;Gazette.net&lt;/a&gt; describes the situation of 22-year-old Ashley Thompson of Germantown. She received a  "certificate of attendance" in 2008, the diploma awarded students when they reach 21, and has been working part-time at a private preschool and has also been volunteering with preschoolers at Germantown Elementary School. But her training has not been deemed sufficient for the school system that educated her to hire her: "School officials balked at the idea because she had only the certificate," her mother, Holly Thompson notes, because &lt;a href="http://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/"&gt;Montgomery County Public Schools&lt;/a&gt; policy requires that paraeducators to have a full-fledged high school diploma and at least one year of college. Ironically, Thompson was regularly featured in Montgomery County Public Schools publications as an example of the success of special needs programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you leave the shiny world of services for those under 21 behind, the bloom is indeed off the proverbial rose. I think we all know what is wrong with that picture.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org&amp;#39;s Autism Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245879572149"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/06/crossword_guy_just_doesnt_get.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/237e1b2451fe9142</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Bad Logic"/><title type="html">Crossword Guy just doesn't get math</title><published>2009-06-24T20:10:55Z</published><updated>2009-06-24T20:10:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~3/jSjzZhJtxXI/crossword_guy_just_doesnt_get.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="html">&lt;p&gt; One of my pet peeves about people and math is that most 
people don't really have a clue of what math is. I've been writing
this blog for something over three years, and by the standards of
a lot of people, I've almost never written about math.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Yesterday, my son's kindergarten class had a picnic. On my way home, 
I was listening to the local NPR station, which was interviewing some
crossword puzzle writer whose name I cannot remember; I will therefore refer
to him as "crossword-boy".  (It was not Will Shortz; Shortz is much smarter than the
guy they were interviewing.) At one point, they asked him something about 
Sudoku.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; His response was a bit disjointed - he couldn't decide whether to talk about
the history of Sudoku or about his opinion of it. His opinion is that it's
incredibly dull and pointless, and that designing good Sudoku doesn't require as
much creativity as designing good crosswords. (Just that much is annoying: I'm
a Sudoku addict, and I've definitely noticed dramatic differences in Sudokus
from different places. Will Shortz's Sudoku books have great ones; most computerized
Sudoku games generate rather boring ones; the ones in most newspapers are 
obviously computer generated.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In the course of babbling about how uninteresting, non-creative, and
unsatisfying Sudoko puzzles are, he let loose with the real stupidity: "You know,
Sudoku doesn't even have to use numbers, it can use any 9 symbols. It's not a
mathematical puzzle &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Because it doesn't rely on arithmetic, according to crossword-boy, 
it's not mathematical &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;. He went on to say that it's 
just a &lt;em&gt;logic&lt;/em&gt; puzzle, not a math puzzle at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Sorry pal, but logic &lt;em&gt;is math&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Sudoku is an incredibly mathematical puzzle. It's not an 
&lt;em&gt;arithmetic&lt;/em&gt; puzzle, but it's a highly mathematical one.
 In computer science terms, it's a moderately
complex constraint-solving puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Math is more than arithmetic. It's more than numbers. Math
is really the formal study of logic and structure. Numbers and arithmetic
are one kind of structured system described using logic which can be
studied and understood using math. But pretty much &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;
with a precise, formal structure to it has at least an element of
mathematics. The structure of crossword-boy's crossword puzzles 
is fundamentally mathematical.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/06/crossword_guy_just_doesnt_get.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~4/jSjzZhJtxXI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Good Math, Bad Math</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245879537514"><id gr:original-id="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/?p=5316">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/493f46cbe660135c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Education"/><category term="Environment"/><category term="autism"/><category term="graduation"/><category term="inclusion"/><category term="school"/><title type="html">Alex’s other principal</title><published>2009-06-24T19:47:38Z</published><updated>2009-06-24T19:47:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.b5media.com/~r/b5media/AutismVox/~3/5i4btFewv7U/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox" type="html">&lt;p&gt;If I can stop crying long enough, I can write a few thoughts on Alex’s graduation from elementary school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex’s school, a NYC public special ed school, has a bunch of locations. They’re schools-within-schools: a few classrooms in a general ed school. In this case, an &lt;a href="http://insideschools.org/index12.php?fs=224&amp;amp;str=48&amp;amp;formtype=name"&gt;elementary school&lt;/a&gt; in Washington Heights whose only drawback is how far it is from our apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike many other schools, the principal of the general ed school — Tracy Walsh — is unusually welcoming to the special ed students. Near the end of kindergarten, Alex came home with a graduation day t-shirt from PS 48. What’s this? I thought. Alex isn’t graduating. Alex doesn’t go to PS 48. On the back of the t-shirt were all the names of the graduating students. And Alex was one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six years later, Alex came home with another graduating t-shirt. Alex is graduating, we realized. And there was his name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/06/alexgrad.jpg" alt="alexgrad" width="480" height="360"&gt;On the way to school we got a phone call from Alex’s teacher asking if we were bringing black pants for Alex. Apparently a letter was sent home (we never got it) asking the graduating students to wear black pants and white shirts. Even if we’d gotten it, I think it would have been near impossible to get Alex into black pants: he only wears khaki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got there, June (his teacher) had somehow gotten him to wear an unfamiliar white t-shirt AND he was sporting a blue ribbon sash. Through the crowds of parents we could see Alex sitting with his teacher. We read the program: Alex would receive two awards, one for reading and a special UFT (United Federation of Teachers) medal of achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he went up to the stage, he was always accompanied by his teacher or an aide. Good thing, because he found the red curtains on the stage irresistible. People laughed, but not unkindly. They applauded when his name was read. Alex’s teacher read names for some of the awards, and the assistant principal of his school, who is leaving to become a principal, was honored. And I think this is what makes me so weepy. It was no surprise that Alex would be somewhat wander-y or would need someone to help him on and off the stage. But that his classmates and teachers and administrators would be so much a part of this big, glorious celebration was unexpected (I know, I should guessed from those t-shirts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not like this in a lot of schools. General ed principals can be uncomfortable with our kids — and in some cases downright unwelcoming. I’m sad that Alex is leaving this beautiful school that was so accepting of how different he is. I know the rest of the world doesn’t have the same serene acceptance of people who are different. But really. Every school should be like PS 48. Every principal, every leader should conduct with the grace and kindness of Tracy Walsh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We bought flowers for Tracy Walsh yesterday morning,  who shrugged off all thanks and said, “They’re all our kids.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What those news stories I post about all have in common is they were written by an outsider reporter, by someone who is covering the protest, the town hall meeting, or the legislative decision, not by someone who is participating.  The news stories may have quotes from a parent or professional (and occasionally, very rarely, from a self-advocate), but they are not first person accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2009/6/21/745361/-No-one-asked-us"&gt;No one asked us&lt;/a&gt;, a blog entry by KibbutzAmiad on DailyKos, is a first person account.  It is a first person account by a support worker that includes the perspective of people who are affected by the budget cuts, but who were, for various reasons, not part of protests, town hall meetings, or giving input into legislative decisions.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long quotes are considered bad form.  But KibbutzAmiad's post is so powerful that deciding what blurbs to crop out was beyond even my brutal editorial sheers.  Do read &lt;a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2009/6/21/745361/-No-one-asked-us"&gt;the whole thing&lt;/a&gt; as well; this is still only an excerpt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine being told that you will lose your means to get to work, your home, your means to grocery shop, and all the people that make up your daily life.  Imagine being told this and being unable to read, unable to do your own banking, unable to take care of yourself in the ways most of us take for granted.  You can't just move home with mom and dad - you are 40, 50, or 60 years old and your parents, if they are alive, are in no position to take care of you.  You have questions, you have terrible fears, and none of the people you have relied on and trusted to help you have any answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the past two weeks have been extremely difficult for all of us.  Every single person I work with is facing the loss of all the structures and components that make up their life.  They are all terrified.  They all feel helpless, and angry.  These are people who have spent a lifetime struggling to cope with a society that tells them daily that they are less than "normal", not worthy of much.  Yet for the most part they remain polite, and friendly, and optimistic.  But this has gutted them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I went to visit one of them, a 43 year old man named Will.  Will looks ten years younger than his actual age.  Unlike many of the people I work with, he is in good shape - he is careful to work out regularly and eat as well as he can on his budget.  He works at a discount store and does a good job, taking the train to work and back.  He smiles a lot, and makes an effort to be friendly, even to strangers.  This takes some extraordinary optimism on his part because strangers have not always been kind to Will.  He does not look "disabled".  But he cannot really read or write, and has an IQ in the low 60s.  He cannot drive or pay his own bills or - most significantly for him right now - handle the complexities of his medical treatment for stage IV melanoma.  All of those tasks are currently handled by the staff that supports him.  All of those services will end July 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;..."No one asked us", he suddenly said, quite forcefully for him - he's very soft spoken normally.  "No one asked us if it was okay to do this.  No one asked us ANYTHING and we're the ones who are hurt by it.  It's not right.  No one asked us."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, they sure as hell did not. In this nation, when changes in public policy are made, who gets asked?  The rich and the powerful.  Those least affected are carefully consulted and their best interests put front and center.  But as Scarlett O'Hara  succinctly put it, it's a sight easier to steal from the poor and weak than from the rich and strong.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've followed the situation in Oregon through my state's &lt;a href="http://www.oregonddcoalition.org/node/165"&gt;self-advocacy channels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/demanding_no_reduction_in_services"&gt;testified&lt;/a&gt; before legislative groups &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/policy_advocacy_elearning_and_post-transition_education"&gt;twice&lt;/a&gt;, and done what I can to prevent the loss of funding which, ultimately, for all the enmasse protest of thousands in my state, I have zero control over.  Sometimes it seems like whether we are asked or not, we will all still lose.  How can we fight this more effectively, before it is too late?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to spend Sunday afternoon taking in a movie and so I went to see Pixar’s Up.  I won’t spoil the film but there were times when there wasn’t a dry eye in the theatre, my own included.  After the movie was over and I dried my tears with some twitter therapy I began thinking  about how the film was able to elicit this response from such a large number of people.  Knowing there are people who are not moved by such displays lead me to today’s question.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seems like a simple question, right? We live in a galaxy — a sprawling city of gas, dust, and over a hundred billion stars — and we see hundreds of billions of them in the sky, so you’d think we have a decent handle on how these objects came to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That turns out not to be the case. Their formation is more complicated than you might expect, but &lt;a href="http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2009/labs/"&gt;a new set of observations reveals an important clue&lt;/a&gt; in the birth process of the largest discrete objects in the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the cool image: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/06/galaxyblobs.jpg" alt="galaxy blobs"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, so it’s not the most photogenic thing in the world. But what is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep optical images of young galaxies reveal that they are surrounded a vast cloud of hydrogen gas, many times larger than the galaxy itself. In a fit of nomenclaturial acumen, astronomers have dubbed these &amp;quot;blobs&amp;quot;. The thing is, to be seen at all from this great distance, the blobs must be tremendously luminous, and there’s no clear source of energy for them. Something must be powering them, but what? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two competing ideas: one was that the gas is simply cooling as it falls in to the galaxy, and that gas radiates away its heat in the form of light (similar to the way a hot iron bar will radiate its heat away as infrared light). That will then power the gas on the outside, causing it to glow. The other idea was that there is some central source of power deep inside the galaxy itself, lighting up the blobs like a light bulb in a smoke-filled room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But which is it? Ah, enter these new observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image on the left is of such a young galaxy with a blob around it. This image is optical (from Japan’s Subaru telescope and Hubble) plus deep infrared (taken using the Spitzer Space Telescope). You can see the blob, falsely colored yellow, and the denser galaxy embedded in it. Look at the upper left part of the blob: see that reddish glow? What could that be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image on the right reveals it. That is the same picture, but added in (in blue) are observations using the Chandra X-ray Observatory. X-rays are only produced through very energetic and violent sources, such as matter swirling around a black hole, or exploding stars. That would certainly explain what’s powering the blobs’ light! But usually these events also produce a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of optical light. Why don’t we see that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reddish glow in the left hand picture is the key. That indicates the galaxy is loaded with dust, made when stars are born and when the explode, too. Dust absorbs optical light, and what does get through can be highly reddened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now it looks like we have a complete picture of what’s going on here: as a galaxy forms from an infalling blob of gas a million light years across, a supermassive black hole coalesces in the center. Matter falls in, swirling madly around it, pouring out X-rays. Just outside this central region of the galaxy, stars are born at tremendous rates, creating lots of dust. The most massive stars explode in just a few million years, also blasting out X-rays, but also making even more dust. The dust blocks our optical view of the bright sources, but the X-rays still can leak out in quantities sufficient to heat up and light up the surrounding blobs of gas. What this means for the galaxy at large is that this huge amount of energy dumped into the blobs may slow and eventually reverse the infall, shutting off the process which forms the galaxy itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we’re seeing here may be the last birth throes of a galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I love about all this — besides the fact that we can know anything at all about what’s going on in an object a million light years across, billions of light years away, and billions of years in the past — is that we need all these observations together to figure this stuff out. The optical light alone presents us with a mystery, and the IR observations help but don’t solve the problem. But when you add the X-ray observations, they reveal the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And think on this… the blobs we’re talking about here are &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt;, dwarfing the galaxies that are forming from them. They contain billions of times the Sun’s mass in raw gas, the building material of stars in a nascent galaxy. And these immense clouds are being lit up by not just supernovae — which are terrifying all by their lonesome, dumping out energy at rates that would turn the Earth into a crispy ember — but also by gigantic black holes smack dab in their galaxy’s hearts, which are blowing out energy in quantities to rival or exceed the supernovae themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet all that power, the true source of energy illuminating the clouds so much we can see them from across half the Universe, is hidden from our telescopes. Or at least it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt;, until we learned to slip the surly bonds of Earth and loft our eyes into space, where X-rays can travel freely, unimpeded by our pesky atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The universe is complex, and if we truly want to understand it, we will need to continue to explore it, and use the combined might of our scientific equipment to investigate it.

Recently, however, three economists (&lt;strong&gt;Jeremy Bulow&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Levin&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Paul Milgrom&lt;/strong&gt;) were hired as consultants to advise a group that was bidding in a spectrum auction that would allow them to provide wireless service.

By following the advice of the economists, the group was able to purchase wireless coverage for the United States for $2.4 billion, while their major competitors ended up paying $3.5 billion for the same spectrum in the same auction. Thus, their advice was worth more than $1 billion to their clients.</summary><author><name>By Steven D.

So there's two new websites out there with quite similar names, &lt;a href="http://rethinkingautism.com/http___www.RethinkingAutism.com/Home.html"&gt;Rethinking Autism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/"&gt;Rethink Autism&lt;/a&gt;. Both sites are about (obviously) autism and have a number of videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://rethinkingautism.com/http___www.RethinkingAutism.com/Home.html"&gt;Rethinking Autism&lt;/a&gt; states that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All too often in the world of autism, celebrity and sex appeal are used to promote pseudo-science that exploits autistic people, their family members and the public. We decided to put those very same factors to work in service of the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://rethinkingautism.com/http___www.RethinkingAutism.com/Videos.html"&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; are entitled "No Link," "Inclusive Education," "Words," and "Pet Peeves," and feature Leeann, the "friend of a family with an autistic child," well, struttin' and showin' her stuff. (Not &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/not_the_good_goods"&gt;this kind of stuff&lt;/a&gt;.) The admittedly "tongue in cheek" videos are, it seems, made to get attention, with something of a reference to a quite well-known &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/evaluate_science_not_celebrity"&gt;celebrity&lt;/a&gt; (not &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/why_people_believe_oprah"&gt;Oprah&lt;/a&gt;, but a friend) whose past included her "exposing herself" in some similar ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The videos on &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/"&gt;Rethink Autism&lt;/a&gt; are meant to teach parents and professionals about ABA therapy. You can &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/AboutUs/SampleLessons.aspx"&gt;subscribe&lt;/a&gt; for a fee ($100/month for personal use) to have access to "hundreds of step-by-step video lessons" and online support from professionals. Some &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/AboutUs/SampleLessons.aspx"&gt;sample lessons&lt;/a&gt; (imitating a peer, labeling prepositions/incidental teaching---familiar to those of whose children have been doing ABA, or to those who themselves are teachers/therapists) can be seen &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/AboutUs/SampleLessons.aspx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/"&gt;Rethink Autism&lt;/a&gt;'s stated &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/AboutUs/OurPhilosophy.aspx"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; is to provide "immediate access to effective and affordable Applied Behavior Analysis-based treatment tools for the growing population affected by autism spectrum disorders," hence the videos and online subscriptions. The Senior Clinical Advisor on the &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/AboutUs/WhoWeAre.aspx"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt; is Bridget Taylor, the Executive Director of one of New Jersey's private autism schools, the &lt;a href="http://www.alpinelearninggroup.org/aboutus/staff.asp"&gt;Alpine Learning Group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the bottom of a page on &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/AboutUs/WhyRethink.aspx"&gt;why rethink autism&lt;/a&gt;, it's noted that: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Imagine what’s possible. Then think again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rethink autism. We don’t just offer hope, we give you help.&lt;br&gt;
rethink autism empowers you to teach today!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, "rethinking autism" on &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/"&gt;Rethink Autism&lt;/a&gt; refers to (I think) that, instead of thinking that it's not possible to teach an autistic child, think again, yes you can (with an emphasis on ABA teaching).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://rethinkingautism.com/http___www.RethinkingAutism.com/Home.html"&gt;Rethinking Autism&lt;/a&gt; also asks people to think differently about autism, with such suggestions as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just because a person with autism may not speak, it does not mean they have an inferior intellect.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.................&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should be more concerned about an autistic individual’s quality of life instead of preventing them from being born. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to self-advocates and learn about neurodiversity. Include the organized community of autistic adults when it comes to making legislation regarding their quality of life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two very different, if very similarly websites, and maybe some would think they oughtn't to be discussed in the same post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But think again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;a href="http://rethinkingautism.com/http___www.RethinkingAutism.com/Home.html"&gt;Rethinking Autism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/"&gt;Rethink Autism&lt;/a&gt; are asking us to think, life with autism isn't----doesn't have to be----hopeless. We need, indeed, to think differently about autism and individuals on the autism spectrum, just as the &lt;a href="http://www.nas.org.uk/"&gt;National Autistic Society&lt;/a&gt; has exhorted people to do with its &lt;a href="http://www.think-differently.org.uk/"&gt;Think Differently&lt;/a&gt; campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

When we went around the table telling what we did for a living, my response garnered some attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you a ghost hunter?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Er, well… no, not exactly.. you see…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I saw a ghost once.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s very interesting, but what I do at the JREF is…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it went. This is not an unusual exchange, and I’m not annoyed in the least. Often, such awkward openings lead to something more interesting, and that was the case here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Asian man approached me and said something very interesting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ghosts are cultural.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though his English was quite good, I didn’t understand what he meant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Via my evil twin &lt;a href="http://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/2009/06/23/possibly-the-best-optical-ilusion-i-have-seen-all-year/"&gt;Richard Wiseman&lt;/a&gt; comes one of the best color optical illusions I have ever seen. The original was apparently posted on &lt;del&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.buzzhunt.co.uk/2009/06/22/green-and-blue/"&gt;Buzzhunt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/del&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.psy.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/color12e.html"&gt;Akiyoshi Kitaoka’s incredible optical illusion website&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.buzzhunt.co.uk/2009/06/22/green-and-blue/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/06/colors.gif" alt="Blue green spiral illusion"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see embedded spirals, right, of green, pinkish-orange, and blue? Incredibly, the green and the blue spirals &lt;em&gt;are the same color&lt;/em&gt;. At first I thought Richard was pulling our collective legs, being a trickster of high magnitude. So I loaded the image in Photoshop and examined the two spirals. In the two squares displayed below, the one on the left is colored using the same color from the blue spiral, and on the right using the green spiral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/06/greenblue2.jpg" alt="green and blue squares"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said, incredible! For pedantry sake, the RGB colors in both spirals are 0, 255, 150. So they are mostly green with a solid splash of blue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason they look different colors is because our brain judges the color of an object by comparing it to surrounding colors. In this case, the stripes are not continuous as they appear at first glance. The orange stripes don’t go through the &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot; spiral, and the magenta ones don’t go through the &amp;quot;green&amp;quot; one. Here’s a zoom to make this more clear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/06/bluegreenzoom.gif" alt="Blue green spirals zoom"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See? The orange stripes go through the &amp;quot;green&amp;quot; spiral but not the &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot; one. So without us even knowing it, our brains compare that spiral to the orange stripes, forcing it to think the spiral is green. The magenta stripes make the other part of the spiral look blue, &lt;strong&gt;even though they are exactly the same color.&lt;/strong&gt; If you still don’t believe me, concentrate on the edges of the colored spirals. Where the green hits the magenta it looks bluer to me, and where the blue hits the orange it looks greener. Amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall pattern is a spiral shape because our brain likes to fill in missing bits to a pattern. Even though the stripes are not the same color all the way around the spiral , the overlapping spirals makes our brain think they are. The very fact that you have to examine the picture closely to figure out any of this at all shows just how easily we can be fooled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I tell people over and over again: &lt;em&gt;you cannot trust what you see even with your own eyes&lt;/em&gt;. Your eyes are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; cameras faithfully taking pictures of absolute truth of all that surrounds you. They have filters, and your brain has to interpret the jangled mess it gets fed. Colors are not what they appear, shapes are not what they appear (that zoomed image above is square, believe it or not), objects are not what they appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the next time someone swears they saw Jesus, or a UFO, or a ghost, show them this picture. What you see in life is absolutely and provably &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; what you get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alas for that line of reasoning, I've noticed that more people are more likely to shout out a certain four-letter word when surprised or hurt or angry, which must mean that sex is god.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This Saturday in Worcester, MA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4th Annual Greater Worcester Humanists Summer Outing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
According to the organizers, you can “network with other New England area freethinkers in a casual, social setting in order to strengthen our community.” Fun! It starts at noon on Jun 27, 2009 at Rutland State Park. &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=110381253081&amp;amp;ref=share"&gt;Here’s the Facebook event page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This Monday in Boston, MA&lt;br&gt;
Boston Skeptics in the Pub: Particle Colliders—The Science &amp;amp; The Fiction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is going to be a good one, people! Shulamit Moed is a post-doc who splits her time between Fermilab (where she measures the production of the charm quark), CERN (where she prepares for the first LHC collisions), and Harvard (where she gives talks in pubs to people like you). It starts at 7pm (show up early if you want a seat!) at Tommy Doyle’s in Harvard Square. &lt;a href="http://www.bostonskeptics.com"&gt;Info at BostonSkeptics.com.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 9 in Vegas, NV&lt;br&gt;
Drinking Skeptically/Skeptics in the Pub at TAM7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Get together with skeptics groups from around the country on the Thursday night before TAM! There will be goodies, plus booze of course. Info over at &lt;a href="http://www.nycskeptics.org/specialevents/dstam7"&gt;NYCSkeptics.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
People need to understand American homebirth midwives are a second class of midwives with less education and training than other American and European midwives. The standards for direct entry midwives, in terms of educational requirements and clinical training, are far below those of any other midwives in the industrialized world. American homebirth midwives are, by and large, quacks, and babies are dying as a result.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Addendum:&lt;/em&gt; One of the things I find most interesting is how everyone involved understands that the refusal to seek real medical care led to this tragedy. Carri's family has removed the posts detailing her actions in the weeks leading up to the catastrophe, and MotheringdotCommune has removed the posts by Carri and those responding to her. The baby died possibly because of unassisted birth/homebirth, and now supporters and the family want to remove the evidence. &lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Liz</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml</id><title type="html">I Speak of Dreams</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245857437312"><id gr:original-id="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/06/dr-gwenn-is-in-how-do-bloggers-get-information-about-swine-flu-a-new-survey-is-trying-to-find-out.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ecc03901da2eee82</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Emergency Preparedness"/><title type="html">Dr. Gwenn Is In: How do bloggers get information about Swine Flu?

&lt;blockquote&gt;How do bloggers get information about Swine Flu? A new survey is trying to find out.
With Swine Flu, Influenza H1N1, now at pandemic levels world wide, gathering data and information about the virus is important to keep us all healthy. Believe it or not, part of the information hunt involves how you get your information on important health issues such as Swine Flu.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Liz</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml</id><title type="html">I Speak of Dreams</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245856280353"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=13855">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/29ec3d758812b79d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="airlines"/><category term="captain steve"/><title type="html">What Captain Sullenberger Meant to Say (But Was Too Polite to Do So): A Guest Post</title><published>2009-06-24T14:57:18Z</published><updated>2009-06-24T14:57:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/24/what-captain-sullenberger-meant-to-say-but-was-too-polite-to-do-so-a-guest-post/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/" type="html">We &lt;a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/26/introducing-captain-steve-who-will-now-take-your-airline-questions/"&gt;recently introduced you&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;Captain Steve&lt;/strong&gt;, an airline pilot for a major U.S. carrier, who will be regularly fielding your questions about any and all aspects of air travel.

&lt;p&gt;He doesn't like chemotherapy, though (and who would?), and there are these interesting rationalizations going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel Hauser was not at the court hearing but later told The Associated Press he had hoped he would be able to stop chemotherapy, which he said makes him ill. 
"I get really sick when I do it," the teen said during an interview at his family's farm at Sleepy Eye. "You get so dizzy and I get a headache right away."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Daniel said he believes his tumor's improvement comes from alternative treatments he's doing such as supplemental drinks and pills.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
His parents also remain concerned about the risks of chemotherapy, which they initially rejected for religious reasons, saying it harms the body. But they told Brown County Judge John Rodenberg during the today's hearing that they would take their son to a Wednesday chemo appointment.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Colleen Hauser told the AP at her home that doctors said it would take six months to treat her son's Hodgkin's lymphoma when he was first diagnosed, but they've now seen improvement in the past few weeks.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"Wow," she said. "Something's working."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But when asked if she credits the chemotherapy, she said, "I'm not going to say it's not, but I just want to make it clear that I would like a better plan, a better treatment plan, for Danny."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You just know that if Daniel is cured, and we all hope he is, he and his mother will blindly give full credit to whatever magic water she has him drinking…anything other than the icky chemotherapy that actually does the job.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/good_news_about_daniel_hauser.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/Z0Hlh_Rj06s" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245854788366"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/06/computing_my_caffeine_habit.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/72cdb6c434788e35</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Health"/><title type="html">Computing My Caffeine Habit</title><published>2009-06-24T13:20:27Z</published><updated>2009-06-24T13:20:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/Pc8yrhUlLcI/computing_my_caffeine_habit.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Strong black tea is my drug of choice. But I &lt;a href="http://saltosobrius.blogspot.com/2006/06/caffeine-withdrawal-headache.html"&gt;got fed up&lt;/a&gt; with caffeine addiction a few years back and started to limit my intake. Currently I'm at 1.5 litres every second day, which means that my system is used to going without caffeine for over 40 hours at a time -- counted from afternoon tea on a Monday to morning tea on a Wednesday for instance. This regimen works out to an average daily intake of 190 milligrams of caffeine. Coffee has about 1.7 times the caffeine in strong black tea, which in turn has 2.7 times the caffeine in Coke. But I never have coffee and very rarely any caffeinated soda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Reader, what's your caffeine habit like? Here are &lt;a href="http://www.wilstar.com/caffeine.htm"&gt;some figures&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coke: ~100 mg caffeine per litre&lt;br&gt;
Strong black tea: ~250 mg caffeine per litre&lt;br&gt;
Coffee: ~425 mg caffeine per litre&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(A litre is about 34.5 fluid ounces.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/06/computing_my_caffeine_habit.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/Pc8yrhUlLcI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245854606627"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_697.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b68070b1e20bf1aa</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Science News"/><title type="html">My picks from ScienceDaily</title><published>2009-06-24T12:52:44Z</published><updated>2009-06-24T12:52:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/yZuXJ27eyZY/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_697.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_697.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_697.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/yZuXJ27eyZY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245854065458"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=13863">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bb129699461763e5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="China"/><category term="military"/><category term="naming"/><title type="html">Mao's Little Red Aircraft Carrier</title><published>2009-06-24T13:43:04Z</published><updated>2009-06-24T13:43:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/24/maos-little-red-aircraft-carrier/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/" type="html">&lt;em&gt;Freakonomics&lt;/em&gt; readers know that a baby's name reveals more about its parents than about the baby.

It’s hard. There is so much nonsense in the world… but I try. I read a lot of blogs, of course. I have about 200 blogs in my feed reader, but only a handful of those have daily posts, and of those I skim a lot. I get email from readers, of course (which I love) when news breaks, and also see things on Twitter. Still, how do you find out what’s going with online skeptical activism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an idea: read Skepdad’s &lt;a href="http://www.resurch.org/"&gt;Epic Reading List&lt;/a&gt;. It really is. Epic, I mean: he’s put a bazillion links in various categories, including blogs, podcasts, thinkers, topic-specific, and so on. I’ve looked it over and it’s a pretty good list if you’re looking to find ways to blow off that big project that’s already overdue. I’m actually a little afraid to delve into more deeply, as I can see my already-neutron-star-dense schedule getting even more tightly squeezed… and that can only have one outcome. A calendrical black hole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you’re looking for a little summer reading (&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/03/06/kirsten-dunst-and-carl-sagan/"&gt;and who isn’t?&lt;/a&gt;) then this is a great place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

He now has a blog post up &lt;a href="http://blogs.answersingenesis.org/aroundtheworld/2009/06/22/a-professors-falsehoods-and-poor-research/"&gt;complaining about me and my "inaccuracies"&lt;/a&gt;. His complaints are amusingly petty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I object to the lies at the very heart of his "museum", and he thinks he is rebutting me by whining over petty details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, he quotes me as regarding the idea of "Noah's ark being built to carry off members of every species on earth", and then he primly informs his readers that that isn't true: it only carried every &lt;i&gt;kind&lt;/i&gt; of "land-dwelling, air-breathing animal". Oh, well, that fixes the logistical problems of the ark right up, doesn't it? Here we have a great big flood that turns the globe into &lt;i&gt;Waterworld&lt;/i&gt;, and he doesn&amp;#39;t have to worry about the effects of salinity changes on aquatic organisms, doesn&amp;#39;t have to think about the plants, and the birds can just stay airborne for a year until the flood recedes. I don&amp;#39;t care what fraction of life on earth the poop-shovelin&amp;#39;, travelin&amp;#39; family of Noah squeezed onto their big imaginary boat — the &lt;i&gt;whole story&lt;/i&gt; is ludicrous and unsupported by the evidence or by sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he complains that I mentioned his "dinosaurs with saddles". He's only got &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt;, he says, and it's out for repairs, and it wasn't out in the exhibits anyway. But again, this is his whole schtick behind the museum: that like the Flintstones, humans and dinosaurs coexisted! He's got exhibits with kids playing with carnivorous dinosaurs, and he specifically claims that dinosaurs existed within the last 10,000 years. The point is that the founding premise of his scammy little "museum" is false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also complains that he doesn&amp;#39;t make any direct accusations of &amp;quot;malice and dishonesty&amp;quot; against biologists in general, but again, that&amp;#39;s the implication he makes by calling evolution a lie and the work of Satan. He says he doesn&amp;#39;t blame Darwin for the world&amp;#39;s problems — that&amp;#39;s caused by &lt;i&gt;sin&lt;/i&gt;, of course — but again, it&amp;#39;s pretending that a major focus of his &amp;quot;museum&amp;quot; is on how godless Darwinism leads people away from the true faith and into depravity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He thinks the numbers I cited are wrong. Well, take it up with the &lt;a href="http://www.ministrywatch.com/profile/Answers-in-Genesis.aspx"&gt;source I cited&lt;/a&gt;, which tracks charitable organizations to give potential donors information on what the institution is doing. Mr Ham can always provide them with up-to-date information, and I'm sure they'll make the numbers more current.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the most pathetic whimper of all: I called it "Ken Ham's 'museum'". It's not his museum, he says, it's the Lord's. Yeah, right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Mr Ham is so concerned about my accuracy or lack thereof, and is obviously stressed at the poor publicity I'm giving his little monument to ignorance, I'll make him an offer. I'll give him a whole day of my time if he'll fly me in and give me a personal tour, during which he can point out all the things I've gotten wrong about Creation, and I will dutifully write them down and post a complete report of his various rebuttals. Thorough coverage for the price of a plane ticket. How can he possibly turn down such an offer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If he was really confident of the legitimacy of his museum, I could probably even gather a small group of mouthy, obnoxious, and culturally prominent godless scientists who'd also take advantage of such an offer, and he could shepherd us all through at once, evangelizing as much as he wanted. It would be great! Come on, Mr Ham, put a little bit of your money where your mouth is.&lt;/p&gt;

No, I never did buy any of that nonsense about how sticking thin needles into the skin at points along various "meridians" somehow "redirects the flow of &lt;em&gt;qi&lt;/em&gt;," that mystical life force upon which so much woo, particularly woo based on Eastern mysticism and traditional Chinese medicine depends. However, because acupuncture involves an actual physical action on the body, namely sticking needles in it, I didn't think it entirely implausible that it might have some sort of physiological effect, such as counterirritation or the release of endorphins, that could relieve pain or induce relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, back then I was still fairly early into my skeptical career of investigating "alternative" medicine claims and hadn't read very many the studies of acupuncture. The more I read, the more I realized that acupuncture is nothing more than yet another elaborate placebo. What it took over the last couple of years for me to give up on acupuncture entirely was reading a steady stream of studies showing that "real" acupuncture is no better than "sham" acupuncture involving either using special needles that don't break the skin, locations &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/06/acupuncture_and_blood_pressure.php"&gt;other than the true "meridian" points&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/05/another_acupuncture_study_misinterpreted.php"&gt;even toothpicks&lt;/a&gt;. Heck, in one case, sham acupuncture &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/04/sham_acupuncture_is_better_than_true_acu.php"&gt;worked better than "real" acupuncture&lt;/a&gt;, but the study authors argued that their study was evidence that "acupuncture works"! In fact, virtually every study that shows no difference between acupuncture and sham acupuncture is still somehow spun by its authors as providing evidence that "acupuncture works" (although they usually do a bit of handwaving and represent it as "more complex" than previously thought). The more I learned, in other words, the more I asked: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/can_we_finally_just_say_that_acupuncture.php"&gt;Can we finally just say that acupuncture is nothing more than an elaborate placebo&lt;/a&gt;? When I started to learn that what is represented as acupuncture today is, in fact, not really even that ancient but rather a modality &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=131"&gt;resurrected by Chairman Mao&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=494"&gt;give the appearance&lt;/a&gt; of bringing health care to his people when he couldn't afford modern, scientific medical modalities, that about sealed it. I saw acupuncture for what it is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/electroacupuncture_the_bait_and_switch_o.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/electroacupuncture_the_bait_and_switch_o.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/Ny_AvNpuZ2A" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245849749545"><id gr:original-id="http://gimpyblog.wordpress.com/?p=530">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/88b9d20e6a052ae6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Mozambique show how to regulate homeopathy in Africa</title><published>2009-06-24T09:36:22Z</published><updated>2009-06-24T09:36:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://gimpyblog.wordpress.com/2009/06/24/mozambique-show-how-to-regulate-homeopathy-in-africa/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">Via the quackometer’s twitterfeed, a story on the allAfrica news aggregation site suggests that the government of Mozambique are responding in a thoroughly sensible manner to alternative medicine practitioners, including homeopaths.

As a chiropractor once admitted to me - there are a great many things that happen under the umbrella of “chiropractic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article I will summarize some of the history and practice of chiropractic, highlighting what I consider to be many of the enduring problems with this profession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiropractic was founded in 1895 by Daniel David Palmer, a grocer with an intense interest in metaphysics.  Prior to his “discovery” of chiropractic, D.D. Palmer was a magnetic healer.  He also had interests in phrenology (diagnosing disease based on the bumps of the skull) and spiritualism.  Palmer reported to have discovered the principle of chiropractic when he allegedly cured a janitor of his deafness by manipulating his neck.  The fact that the nerve which conveys sound information from the ears to the brain does not pass through the neck did not seem to bother Palmer, if he was even aware of this fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmer created the term “chiropractic,” which literally means “done by hand,” to refer to his new therapy.  He argued that all disease is caused by subluxated bones, which 95% of the time are spinal bones, and which disrupt the flow of innate intelligence.  He did not subject his ideas to any form of research, but rather went directly to treating patients and to teaching his principles to the first generation of chiropractors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subluxation Theory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmer believed in the pre-scientific vitalistic notion that health stems from the flow of a spiritual life force. Although vitalism was rapidly declining within scientific thought by the end of the 19th century, it was the centerpiece of early philosophies of health in most cultures. Palmer borrowed this ancient belief and renamed it “innate intelligence” which he claimed flowed from the brain to the rest of the body through the spinal cord and peripheral nerves.  All disease, he argued, results from disruption in the flow of innate intelligence. Disruption in flow is caused by spinal subluxations, which are small misalignments in the spine that compress the spinal nerves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, liver disease is caused by a subluxation which compresses the spinal nerve which supplies the liver with life force, depriving it of its vital innate intelligence.  Palmer therefore believed he could cure by fixing these misalignments with manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea has remained the cornerstone of chiropractic despite advances in neurobiology and anatomy which have failed to show any evidence for innate intelligence or chiropractic subluxations.  Many continue to ascribe all disease to the blockage of innate intelligence despite scientific advances in medicine which have discovered infectious, genetic, autoimmune, degenerative, nutritional, and other causes for many of the diseases which plague mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiropractic was also not the only tradition based upon manipulating the bones. Of note, osteopathic doctors also developed an art of bone manipulation in order to heal, but they believed they were unblocking blood flow through arteries. Osteopathy and chiropractic had similar roots, but took very different paths, as we will see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D.D. Palmer’s son, B.J. Palmer, became involved in the chiropractic movement early on, during the formative years.  B.J shared his father’s metaphysical bent (prior to chiropractic, he worked with a mesmerist and worked in the circus), his tendency to make sweeping statements about health without justification, and his ignorance of contemporary scientific knowledge. He was reported to state, for example, “When I saw there was no use for a sympathetic nervous system, I threw it out, and then just had to put something better in its place, so I discovered Direct Mental Impulse.” B.J. also “discovered” a non-existent “Duct of Palmer” connecting the spleen to the stomach.  In 1907 B.J. engineered a hostile take over of his father’s school of  chiropractic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B.J. Palmer set the tone that would later dominate the field of chiropractic.  He emphasized salesmanship, advertising, and practice building.  He was highly critical of medicine, stating that M.D. stands for “more death.”  He continuously sought new methods for increasing revenues, such as his neurocalometer, which would pinpoint subluxations by measuring skin temperature and he decreed must be rented from him by other practitioners at exorbitant fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the beginning chiropractors were also politically aggressive.  They sought licensure as a protection from the growing scientific medicine with which they were completely at odds.  Many legislators were reluctant to license chiropractors for this reason, but as more and more states voted in licensure, it became increasingly difficult to fight.  Additionally, many legislators looked upon licensure as way of controlling the scope of chiropractic. By 1925, 32 states had instituted licenses for chiropractors. The struggle ended in 1974 when Louisiana instituted licensing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many states then began to pass basic science board requirements for licensure, making chiropractors pass the same tests of basic science knowledge as medical and osteopathic students.  This was justified by the fact that chiropractors were presenting themselves as primary practitioners. However, where roughly 86 percent of medical students passed their basic science boards between 1927 and 1953, only 23 percent of chiropractors did. Chiropractors who could not pass the boards either moved to another state without the requirement, or practiced without a license.  Between 1967 and 1979 all of the basic science laws for chiropractors were repealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years chiropractic has never ceased its tireless struggle for growth and acceptance.  Despite the fact that scientific medicine has continued to progress and chiropractic has never shed its pseudoscientific origins, they have been quite successful. After licensure, they gained coverage under Medicare.  They have also successfully sued the AMA to stop their antichiropractic campaign. Today they continue to lobby hard for increased coverage and access under health insurance and HMO policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Straights, Mixers, and Reformers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost since the beginning, chiropractic has been fraught with many internal schisms. Today there is a wide range of differences between individual chiropractors, but most can be placed within one of three basic types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Straight chiropractors consider themselves the only true or pure chiropractors because they limit their practice to the identification and treatment of spinal subluxations. They adhere strictly to Palmer’s concept of disease and believe that all ailments can be treated through manipulation to restore the flow of innate intelligence. Once freely flowing, they believe innate intelligence has unlimited power to naturally heal the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Straight chiropractors are the most extreme in their anti-scientific views.  They &lt;a href="http://www.visionchiro.com/chiropractic.html"&gt;openly advocate a philosophical rather than a scientific basis for health care&lt;/a&gt;, calling mainstream medicine “mechanistic” and “allopathic.”  They call physicians “drug pushers” and disparage the use of surgery. They are careful not to give diseases names, but none-the-less they claim to cure disease with their adjustments. They oppose vaccinations. They also openly advocate the replacement of scientific medicine with chiropractic as primary health care. The statements of Dr. Wilson A. Morgan (who just passed away earlier this month), previous Executive Officer of Life College School of Chiropractic, are typical:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;	“Chiropractic: The health care system whose time as the official guardian of the public’s health is fast approaching!”&lt;br&gt;
“On the other hand, it is equally appropriate for chiropractors to be viewed as generalists in that the far-reaching effects of their highly specific spinal adjustments usually are followed by the decrease and often disappearance of a very broad array of symptoms, disabilities and pathological conditions.”&lt;br&gt;
“Unlike the medical profession, chiropractic has a very strong philosophical basis, which no doubt has contributed to its having been labeled ‘unscientific’ by the more mechanistically-oriented scientific community.”&lt;br&gt;
“It appears that education will prove to be the best strategy in the ‘war on drugs,’ including education about the dangers of drugs available on the street and also those available from the physician as prescriptions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mixers, comprising the largest segment of chiropractors, may at first seem more rational.  They accept that some disease is caused by infection or other causes and they do not limit their practice to fixing subluxations.  Most chiropractors in this group, however, do not supplement subluxation theory with scientific medicine, but rather with an eclectic array of pseudoscientific alternative practices.  Mixers commonly prescribe homeopathic and herbal remedies, practice acupuncture and therapeutic touch, diagnose with iridology, contour analysis, and applied kinesiology, and adhere to the philosophy of naturopathy. This broad use of unproven, unscientific, and fanciful so-called “alternative” practices clearly indicates an antiscience attitude, as well as a lack of scientific knowledge, on the part of those chiropractors who employ them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rhetoric of Mixers indicates that they are attempting to become accepted into the scientific mainstream, rather than replace scientifically based medicine with a philosophy based approach.  They no longer openly oppose immunization, like straights do, but they do advocate the freedom to choose whether or not to be immunized.  Their appeal to freedom is emotionally effective, especially in the United States, but it fails to recognize that immunization is far less effective in eliminating or containing infectious diseases when it is not given to everyone.  They also advocate a role for chiropractors as a primary care portal of entry system within HealthCare, despite the fact that they lack adequate training as generalists skilled in medical diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small minority of chiropractors, numbering only about 1,000, or 2% of all chiropractors (these are rough estimates because accurate figures are lacking), have been openly critical of their own field.  They have called for absolute rejection of the subluxation theory of illness, disposing of pseudoscientific and unethical practices by chiropractors, and the restriction of chiropractic to treating acute musculoskeletal symptoms.  They are attempting to bring their field into the scientific mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally chiropractic reformers have attempted to forge a new profession, entirely shedding the pseudoscience attached to the chiropractic brand. About ten years ago one group in Canada renamed themselves “Orthopractors,” and considered the new discipline of orthopractic as distinct from chiropractic.  Orthopractic is the use of manipulation to provide symptomatic relief from uncomplicated acute back strain.  They do not believe in maintenance therapy, treating medical ailments, or the use of pseudoscientific alternative practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this reform effort died because “orthopractic” did not exist as a legal entity. This also partly explains why the “chiropractic” label persists and covers such a wide range of philosophy and practice - because it exists as a recognized licensed profession. It has a regulatory inertia that is hard to combat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further complicate things, spinal manipulation exists outside of the chiropractic profession, and not all manipulation is chiropractic manipulation. Some physiatrists, sports medicine doctors, and osteopaths legitimately employ manipulative therapy to relieve muscle strain, mobilize joints, and improve function. Chiropractors do this as well. But some chiropractors also do chiropractic manipulation designed to realign the spine and reduce imaginary chiropractic subluxations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Evidence - Subluxations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past 100 years, there has been very little research conducted into the basic principles of straight chiropractic. There is no research that indicates the existence of innate intelligence or that such a force plays any role in health and disease. Further, the evidence strongly suggests that chiropractic subluxations are a figment of the chiropractic imagination. And it also seems that spinal manipulation is not capable of realigning the vertebra of the spine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study carried out by Edmund Crelin, Ph.D. investigated the amount of force necessary to displace vertebral bones of the spine in order to cause impingement of a spinal nerve.  The study was carried out on six corpses within 8 hours after death.  His conclusion was that the amount of force necessary to actually displace the vertebra was great enough to break the spine, arguing strongly that chiropractic manipulation cannot significantly affect spinal alignment, and that misaligned spines do not caused pinched nerves (Crelin, 1973).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pinched or impinged spinal nerves do occur, but they are caused by herniated discs, fractures, tumors, or overgrowth of the vertebral bones. When spinal nerves are impinged they cause pain, numbness, and tingling and may cause a decrease or loss of deep tendon reflexes and weakness of the muscles supplied by the affected nerve.  Impinged nerves are not caused by subluxations nor do they result in diseases of the organs.  Believers in subluxation theory must claim, implausibly, that nerve impingement causes only a blockage of innate intelligence without causing any of the known signs and symptoms of such impingement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, spinal manipulation is contraindicated in cases of actual nerve impingement and should not be performed. In medical studies of manipulation, such as the RAND study, often cited by chiropractors as evidence for manipulation, spinal nerve impingement was considered a reason not to have manipulation and therefore was a criteria for exclusion from the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another source of evidence that the chiropractic theory of subluxations and innate intelligence is completely false comes from the unfortunate victims of spinal trauma. There are many victims of complete transection, or disruption, of the cervical spinal cord in the neck.  Such a complete injury leaves its victim quadraplegic, unable to move the arms or legs.  If the injury is high enough in the spinal cord the victim may not even be able to breath on their own.  In such victims no impulses from the brain are able to travel below the spinal cord in the neck, and therefore most of the communication between the brain and the body is interrupted. Certainly, this is a much more dramatic and complete interference of nerve flow than that of an impinged spinal nerve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, in these patients, the organs continue to work without difficulty and diseases do not develop at any higher rate than those without such an injury.  Of course, there are some effects from the disruption of the autonomic nervous system, that part of the nervous system which regulates the bladder, the degree of bowel motility, and other functions. But all effects of spinal cord damage are caused by known neurological injury. If subluxation theory were correct, then patients with high spinal cord injuries would be ravaged by every conceivable disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So chiropractors cannot realign the spine to fix imaginary subluxations and restore the flow of nonexistent innate intelligence.  Subluxation theory is pure pseudoscience, like homeopathy or therapeutic touch, and has no place in a 21st century scientific health care system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the extreme scientific implausibility of subluxation theory, specific applications have been tested with clinical research - with predictable results. For example, many chiropractors will use manipulation to treat asthma is children. &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9761802?dopt=Abstract"&gt;The results of this research are soundly negative&lt;/a&gt; - chiropractic does not work on asthma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this many chiropractors persist in treating asthma. This led Simon Singh to write in the Guardian in 2008 that the British Chiropractic Association, which does advocate chiropractic for childhood asthma, “promotes bogus therapies.” In response to this statement the BCA notably did not provide the evidence that Singh claimed was missing. Rather, they sued him for libel (the case is ongoing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week I will cover the evidence for musculoskeletal uses of chiropractic.&lt;/p&gt;

As we sat in her living room, this ordinary appearing middle-aged woman spoke to the small gathering in the voice of D’Hartma, the spirit of a man who allegedly last lived more than 1000 years ago in Nepal, but now resides in the seventh spiritual dimension.  Lynne has been channeling (the modern word for this form of spirit summoning) D’Hartma for 24 years, and claims that his only purpose is to bring his philosophy of love and spirituality to mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Brief History of Spiritualism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern channelers are the successors to a long history of spiritualism in this and other countries, which has waxed and waned in popularity over the centuries.  The most recent rise in popularity of spiritualism prior to its modern resurgence, was around the turn of the century.  This was the age of mediums and seances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classic séance involved several people gathering in the parlor of a medium, who, with the lights off, would summon the spirits of their client’s lost loved-ones. As proof of the presence of the spirit, there were often many physical manifestations, such as rappings, bell ringing, or other noises, items moving about the room, and levitating tables.  These “parlor tricks” were often very persuasive to those who already had a strong desire to believe, and were likely not schooled in the techniques of magic. The spirits would sometimes speak in a disembodied voice, speak to the medium, who would then relay their messages, or would speak  directly through the medium, who would be in a trance state while the spirit used their voice to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Predictably, the messages contained vague and pleasant sentiments likely to validate the hopes of those seeking the services of a medium.  “Aunt Alice says she is happy where she is, and you should no longer worry about her.  She want me to tell you that she loves you.”  At times cold reading techniques would be used to give the illusion that the medium had knowledge that could only come from the deceased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with this form of physical mediumship (for the mediums, that is) is that they were vulnerable to discovery.  If someone caught them ringing a bell with their toes, or lifting the table with a rod placed in their sleeves, then they were caught red-handed, and were branded a fraud with no plausible deniability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This made the spiritualism-debunking work of Harry Houdini very immediate and satisfying.  Houdini, the most famous magician of his time and also an ardent skeptic, knew that the mediums of his day were using standard magical and escapist techniques to pull off their cons.  He knew because he recognized all the tricks, and could do them himself, better, in fact, than the mediums (similar, in this respect, to James Randi’s modern debunking career).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry Houdini was part of a committee put together by Scientific American magazine, to investigate spiritualism.  He caught medium after medium in the act of committing blatant fraud, exposing them to the public.  He was almost single-handedly responsible for the sharp decline in physical mediumship in the early 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Rise of Channeling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although physical mediumship disappeared, largely through the efforts of Houdini, spiritualism survived and adapted. The solution for mediums was actually quite simple – eliminate the physical aspects of talking to spirits and simply just talk to them or allow them to speak through you.  This eliminates any physical evidence of fraud or trickery, for the only evidence of the presence of a spirit is in the mind of the medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two basic techniques of non-physical mediumship developed in the latter half of the 20th century.  One type involves “psychics” or “sensitives” who can speak to spirits, and then relay what they hear to their clients.  This form of spiritualism is little more than a variation of cold reading. The most widely known current practitioner of this form is John Edward, made famous by his show Crossing Over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other form of non-physical mediumship is called channeling, in which the channeler goes into a trance and then becomes “possessed” by a specific spirit, who then talks through them.  The most successful and widely known channeler of this variety is J.Z. Knight, who claims to channel the spirit of Ramtha, a 30 thousand year old man.  At her height, Knight was channeling Ramtha in front of audiences with thousands of people, and was bringing in millions of dollars from true-believers. She still has a loyal cult following, but her popularity has declined significantly in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The art of channeling is actually quite easy to perform.  All that is needed is a modicum of acting ability and a simple, feel-good philosophy to peddle.  The standard new-age fluff will do.  Following J.Z. Knights success, small-time channelers proliferated, but most followed what had become the standard format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D’Hartma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NESS was not surprised to learn that we have a channeler right here in New England, in Winsted, CT in the northern part of the state.   Lynn LaFountain claims she has been channeling the spirit of D’Hartma for 24 years.  D’Hartma,, apparently, has had many incarnations but his last incarnation was of an illiterate Hindu who lived in Nepal from AD 932-968.  After dying he went, as we all do, according to D’Hartma and his followers, to the first spiritual dimension (there are nine in total).  D’Hartma decided not to reincarnate, which he says is an irrevocable decision, and rather has gone on to higher spiritual dimensions, finally arriving at the seventh dimension, which is the realm of masters.  Masters, of which there are always 144 at any time (an even gross), have achieved a sufficient level of spiritual enlightenment to teach other spirits how to advance.  It is this mission which brings D’Hartma to the Earth to spread his philosophy to mankind. When his mission is complete, he will progress onto the eighth dimension and then finally onto the ninth dimension where he will merge with the god entity of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we were very excited to have the opportunity to speak directly to such an ancient and wise spirit, or at least someone pretending to be an ancient and wise spirit.  Prior to the interview, we were asked (communications were handled over e-mail) to provide the names and backgrounds of the NESS investigators who would attend.  I dutifully complied with background information for myself and Perry DeAngelis, who was to accompany me.  At the last minute, however, Perry could not attend the session and Evan Bernstein (the CT Vice-chairman), came in his place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some preliminary questions, Lynn was ready to begin the channeling.  In addition to Evan, myself, and Lynne, five of D’Hartma’s faithful followers were in attendance. Lynn explained to us that what she does is actually called soul transference, because while D’Hartma is in her body, her spirit will be in the tunnel which leads to the seventh dimension (not actually in the seventh dimension itself). She began by assuming the obligatory lotus position in her easy chair, arms in her lap.  She closed her eyes and began slow deep breathing.  In a few moments her head dropped forward, and we were informed that Lynn was now gone.  A few moments more and her hands began to slowly twitch, as if coming to life.  They then assumed a thoughtful position, with forefingers extended together, and we were informed that D’Hartma had arrived.  Without further warning, Lynn’s body sprang to life, and I found myself being addressed by a strange voice tinted with a vaguely Indian accent.&lt;br&gt;
I had feared that we would get nothing more from D’Hartma than a repetition of his philosophy, which I had already read on their website.  We did, in fact, get that, but there was more.  To my delight, Evan and I were treated to personal readings.  D’Hartma informed me that I have an interest in science and teaching others about science (amazing, considering that Lynn knew I am an academic neurologist at Yale). He also told me that my true desire is to discover the ultimate nature of the universe, but I must be more open and look beyond science for this.  Finally, D’Hartma made a specific prediction, that I would be taking a long trip on a very large boat sometime soon.  Evan received a somewhat more generic reading.  He was told that he is a more powerful person than he realizes, and that he is a “blessed spirit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D’Hartma’s reading was, from my perspective, completely unimpressive and predictable.  The statements made about myself were not very insightful, and could easily be derived from information Lynn was given about me.  Looking at the statements from the perspective of a cold reading, I suspect that the boat trip prediction was an attempt at a high-probability hit, given the fact that I am a physician, and might be taking a cruise sometime in the future.  What Lynne (and D’Hartma) apparently did not know about me is that I am very susceptible to sea sickness and have no intention of getting on a large boat at any time in my future.  Still, we will see if the fates conspire to force me into a boat trip any time soon.  So far (now 9 years later), there are no signs of this.  It is also very telling that Evan’s reading was far more generic than my own.  D’Hartma’s level of knowledge about the two of us seemed to mirror the amount of information Lynn had available to her (remember that Evan was a last-minute substitution for Perry).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the rest of the session.  Most of it was spent discussing D’Hartma’s philosophy and the nature of the spiritual dimensions.  Here again, D’Hartma failed to impress.  His philosophy is a variation of the standard new-age themes of “limitations are all in the mind,” “Love is the greatest power in the universe,” and “We all contain god within ourselves.” Most of his advise somehow related to these basic themes.  That’s it.  You can save yourself the $150 Lynn charges for sessions with D’Hartma, you have just heard the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to preaching this philosophy, D’Hartma apparently dispenses sound financial advise on the side as well.  Lynn reports that she has a clientele of wealthy and famous (and, of course, anonymous) people who have prospered from D’Hartma’s financial wisdom.  D’Hartma also dispenses medical advice.  Here, too, the philosophy is all too predictable new age nonsense.    Disease is also all in the mind.  If you believe yourself to be sick, then you are sick.  If you do no accept illness, then it cannot harm you.  One of those present asked D’Hartma if the fatigue they have been feeling recently is a sign of any illness they should be concerned about.  D’Hartma reassured them that they were fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interview with D’Hartma contained a few other details that may be helpful to a rational assessment of Lynn’s claims.  D’Hartma, although he speaks with a distinct accent that is reminiscent of the region of Nepal, could not speak Nepalese.  He speaks only in English, which is the only knowledge that he derives from Lynn.  Otherwise, he does not have access to her knowledge. One might wonder why D’Hartma remembers his life in Nepal, but not the language.  One might also wonder why, if he derives his knowledge of English from Lynn, he speaks in the broken and accented English one would expect from a foreigner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D’Hartma did speak one word of Nepalese, Namaste, which is a greeting (used for both hello and goodbye) which means “I bow to the divinity within you.” This is about as impressive as claiming to channel the spirit of King Kamehameha but not being able to speak Haiwaiin - but only being able to say “aloha” in a cheesy accent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D’Hartma also made the following claims: he does not perceive the passage of time while in the spiritual dimension; time has no meaning to him, since past, present, and future are all the same thing and time is merely a man-made construct; he did not pay attention to events on Earth while in the spiritual dimension, nor communicate with other spirits, as he was consumed with the task of gaining spiritual wisdom; and he lived from AD 932-968.  Someone who is less than completely trusting might wonder how D’hartma would know the dates in which he last lived.   The Christian calendar was not in wide-spread use in the tenth century even in Europe, and was unknown in Nepal, especially to an illiterate peasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I found it amusing that D’Hartma claimed that people only use 15% of their brain, a common new age myth with no scientific validity. The other 85% is allegedly used to “channel energy,” however this 85% is dormant and unused in most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lynn’s background is pretty much what one would expect from a new age channeler.  She says that her mother is American Indian, and so Lynn was raised with spiritual beliefs.  When she was young she had many encounters with spirits.  At one time she claims she saw ghosts leaving a burning building.  She believes in astrology and reincarnation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lynn has also followed the career of JZ Knight and says she does not believe Knight is genuine. Perhaps she was at first, but isn’t any longer.  She also reports that Knight was part of her inspiration for her current channeling career.  She had stopped channeling D’Hartma for a period of time, until a friend of hers was lamenting the fact that she could not afford the exorbitant fee Knight charges to attend a channeling session.  Lynn graciously offered to channel for her, and has been doing it ever since.  At the time of the investigation Lynn was living off the fees she charged to consult D’Hartma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lynn also is not impressed with James von Prague, and believes he is just a fast talker.  We were also amused to discover that Lynn had a brief association with our old friends, Ed and Lorraine Warren.  Apparently, the Warrens wanted D’Hartma to help them banish a demon.  D’Hartma, however, informed the Warrens that there is no such thing as evil, and that there were no evil spirits in the house the Warrens were about to exorcise. Thus ended their brief association, a victim to competing paranormal belief systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only physical aspect of Lynn’s channeling is what she called the “water miracles.”  D’Hartma can apparently summon water or burst water pipes as validation that he is genuine.  He did not manifest any water miracles for us, leading me to conclude that he either cannot do so, or chose not to, which was definitely a bad call on his part.  A few days prior to our interview, D’Hartma was interviewed by a local news station, and had promised the reporter a water miracle.  When asked by one of his followers if the water miracle had occurred, D’Hartma responded, “No, because he is looking for it too much.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our evening with D’Hartma was certainly an interesting experience.  Lynn’s performance, however, was predictable and unimpressive.  It was stylistically very similar to the standard model of the current channeling phenomenon. I found D’Hartma’s philosophy to be simplistic new age, feel-good tripe, with no new metaphysical elements.  The details offered were also lacking, including D’Hartma’s inability to speak his native language, the problems with time, the mediocre cold reading complete with poor prediction, and the endorsement of common new age mythology.&lt;br&gt;
If we consider the two most obvious hypotheses to explain Lynn’s apparent channeling of D’Harmta, either she is genuinely channeling a spirit from the seventh dimension, or she is pretending to do so, what can we conclude about which of these two hypotheses is more likely to be correct?  The fact that Lynn’s performance fits so cleanly into the standard new age model, I find to be a compelling argument that D’Hartma is a cultural construct, not a genuine entity.  The principle of Occom’s Razor would also favor the far simpler explanation that D’Hartma is a product of Lynn’s mind and nothing more, since this hypothesis adequately explains all available evidence, without having to introduce new extraordinary elements, such as nine spiritual dimensions and reincarnation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I am satisfied with this mundane explanation for Lynn’s claims, I still can’t help feeling somewhat unfulfilled.  Her performance offered no opportunity for a Houdini-style exposure.  No climactic “Aha!, Caught you.”  And I suppose that is the point of non-physical mediums - plausible deniability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so it went. This is not an unusual exchange, and I’m not annoyed in the least. Often such awkward openings lead to something more interesting, and that was the case here.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>jrefmail@randi.org (Jeffrey Wagg)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245828798907"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/rehinking_autism">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/56f09833341931a4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><title type="html">Rehink(ing) Autism</title><published>2009-06-24T07:30:00Z</published><updated>2009-06-24T07:30:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/rehinking_autism" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://autism.change.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3151/3287404615_41d8370267_o.jpg" height="180" alt="Question mark formed by footprints in sand from http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3151/3287404615_41d8370267_o.jpg" style="float:right;border-color:initial;margin-top:0px;margin-right:8px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;padding:2px" width="150"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So there's two new websites out there with quite similar names, &lt;a href="http://rethinkingautism.com/http___www.RethinkingAutism.com/Home.html"&gt;Rethinking Autism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/"&gt;Rethink Autism&lt;/a&gt;. Both sites are about (obviously) autism and have a number of videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://rethinkingautism.com/http___www.RethinkingAutism.com/Home.html"&gt;Rethinking Autism&lt;/a&gt; states that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All too often in the world of autism, celebrity and sex appeal are used to promote pseudo-science that exploits autistic people, their family members and the public. We decided to put those very same factors to work in service of the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://rethinkingautism.com/http___www.RethinkingAutism.com/Videos.html"&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; are entitled "No Link," "Inclusive Education," "Words," and "Pet Peeves," and feature Leeann, the "friend of a family with an autistic child," well, struttin' and showin' her stuff. (Not &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/not_the_good_goods"&gt;this kind of stuff&lt;/a&gt;.) The admittedly "tongue in cheek" videos are, it seems, made to get attention, with something of a reference to a quite well-known &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/evaluate_science_not_celebrity"&gt;celebrity&lt;/a&gt; (not &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/why_people_believe_oprah"&gt;Oprah&lt;/a&gt;, but a friend) whose past included her "exposing herself" in some similar ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The videos on &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/"&gt;Rethink Autism&lt;/a&gt; are meant to teach parents and professionals about ABA therapy. You can &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/AboutUs/SampleLessons.aspx"&gt;subscribe&lt;/a&gt; for a fee ($100/month for personal use) to have access to "hundreds of step-by-step video lessons" and online support from professionals. Some &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/AboutUs/SampleLessons.aspx"&gt;sample lessons&lt;/a&gt; (imitating a peer, labeling prepositions/incidental teaching---familiar to those of whose children have been doing ABA, or to those who themselves are teachers/therapists) can be seen &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/AboutUs/SampleLessons.aspx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/"&gt;Rethink Autism&lt;/a&gt;'s stated &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/AboutUs/OurPhilosophy.aspx"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; is to provide "immediate access to effective and affordable Applied Behavior Analysis-based treatment tools for the growing population affected by autism spectrum disorders," hence the videos and online subscriptions. The Senior Clinical Advisor on the &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/AboutUs/WhoWeAre.aspx"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt; is Bridget Taylor, the Executive Director of one of New Jersey's private autism schools, the &lt;a href="http://www.alpinelearninggroup.org/aboutus/staff.asp"&gt;Alpine Learning Group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the bottom of a page on &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/AboutUs/WhyRethink.aspx"&gt;why rethink autism&lt;/a&gt;, it's noted that: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Imagine what’s possible. Then think again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rethink autism. We don’t just offer hope, we give you help.&lt;br&gt;
rethink autism empowers you to teach today!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, "rethinking autism" on &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/"&gt;Rethink Autism&lt;/a&gt; refers to (I think) that, instead of thinking that it's not possible to teach an autistic child, think again, yes you can (with an emphasis on ABA teaching).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://rethinkingautism.com/http___www.RethinkingAutism.com/Home.html"&gt;Rethinking Autism&lt;/a&gt; also asks people to think differently about autism, with such suggestions as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just because a person with autism may not speak, it does not mean they have an inferior intellect.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.................&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should be more concerned about an autistic individual’s quality of life instead of preventing them from being born. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to self-advocates and learn about neurodiversity. Include the organized community of autistic adults when it comes to making legislation regarding their quality of life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two very different, if very similarly websites, and maybe some would think they oughtn't to be discussed in the same post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But think again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;a href="http://rethinkingautism.com/http___www.RethinkingAutism.com/Home.html"&gt;Rethinking Autism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/"&gt;Rethink Autism&lt;/a&gt; are asking us to think, life with autism isn't----doesn't have to be----hopeless. We need, indeed, to think differently about autism and individuals on the autism spectrum, just as the &lt;a href="http://www.nas.org.uk/"&gt;National Autistic Society&lt;/a&gt; has exhorted people to do with its &lt;a href="http://www.think-differently.org.uk/"&gt;Think Differently&lt;/a&gt; campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a shady operation that constantly makes false claims about products and rips people off.  Sandler was mocking a real phenomenon--the liquidation companies named "going out of business" or "total liquidation sale."  The Journal has a fun &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124579907861644365.html"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on the issue today, focusing on a rug salesman who has settled down in Texas for a permanent going out of business sale.  Barry Newman reports:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many localities do have rules against such claims. New York City asks stores to get licenses for angst-inspired specials, from "fire sale" to "lost our lease." Texas asks the same. But with blowouts on every corner, there's been no burst in enforcement. Texas has issued 49 such licenses since 2001 -- and prosecuted one used-car dealer in Austin.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/06/making_a_business_of_going_out.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/nZFOnB2Dqa0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245824088885"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/leave_journalism_to_profession.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e9d683b27e078743</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Media"/><title type="html">Leave journalism to professionals!</title><published>2009-06-24T04:31:54Z</published><updated>2009-06-24T04:31:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/Ey8ca36Wp7c/leave_journalism_to_profession.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Or better not.

Basically, Zicam was approved without testing to show it to be both safe and efficacious because it slipped in using an old 1938 law that allows homeopathic remedies to bypass the usual process for FDA approval. Too bad that, due to the zinc in Zicam, it can cause anosmia, or the loss of the sense of smell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen Colbert, of course, thinks it must be the Democrats who are plotting against one of Rush Limbaugh's main sponsors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...Lee's yoga focuses on Brain Education, or as one official put it, "using your brain well." Part of this training includes the head-shaking Brain Wave Vibration exercise...Participants take basic yoga classes and are reportedly encouraged to attend pricey workshops, retreats and healing sessions.

(Warning: clicking on that link will cause Linkin Park to start playing the chorus of &lt;em&gt;New Divide&lt;/em&gt; through your computer&amp;#39;s sound system, which may not be what you want…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some parts of the movie were shot here at Penn — including one scene in the Quad, where I live:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Transformers1a.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click for a larger version" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Transformers1a.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this screenshot from the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhtGnCa8x2k"&gt;trailer&lt;/a&gt;, the (added by me) red ellipse marks my dining room window, next to which I generally sit while blogging at breakfast. The trailer suggests that I can expect to get cinematically blown to CGI bits along with pretty much every everything else in the movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This geographical accident is not the only linguistic connection. According to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers:_Revenge_of_the_Fallen"&gt;Wikipedia entry&lt;/a&gt;'s plot description, "Sam Witwicky heads off to college in an attempt to live a normal life. Whilst packing, he finds another shard of the AllSpark which fills his mind with ancient Cybertronian text."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam in turn carves some of this text in the turf, as shown here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Transformers2.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that this ancient Cybertronian text is the movie&amp;#39;s MacGuffin — &amp;quot;the language Sam sees is of the Dynasty of Primes, the original seven Transformers, who powered the AllSpark like a battery by destroying suns&amp;quot;, according to Wikipedia. And the text somehow encodes &amp;quot;information on the location of a new energon signal&amp;quot;, which the evil transformers want to dissect Sam&amp;#39;s brain to find. Or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps there's a well-defined made-up language behind this text, but if so, I haven't been able to learn anything about it. Maybe that's just as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update — Roger Ebert &lt;a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090623/REVIEWS/906239997"&gt;was not impressed&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&amp;quot;Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen&amp;quot; is a horrible experience of unbearable length […]  If you want to save yourself the ticket price, go into the kitchen, cue up a male choir singing the music of hell, and get a kid to start banging pots and pans together. Then close your eyes and use your imagination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The plot is incomprehensible. The dialog of the Autobots, Deceptibots and Otherbots is meaningless word flap. Their accents are Brooklyese, British and hip-hop, as befits a race from the distant stars. Their appearance looks like junkyard throw-up. They are dumb as a rock.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess it follows from this, as Michael Cieply &lt;a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/20/transformers-sequel-off-to-red-hot-start-in-british-cinemas/"&gt;tells us&lt;/a&gt; in the NYT's Media Decoder column, that "company executives were privately speculating that the new “Transformers” film had a shot at becoming Paramount’s second-highest grossing film, behind 'Titanic'".  I can't wait to see it, myself. ]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update #2 — Cosma Shalizi, in a &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1535#comment-34611"&gt;characteristically astute comment&lt;/a&gt;, points us to a review by Charlie Jane Anders, "&lt;a href="http://io9.com/5301898/michael-bay-finally-made-an-art-movie"&gt;Michael Bay Finally Made An Art Movie&lt;/a&gt;", which I can't resist quoting in part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Critical consensus on &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is overwhelmingly negative. But the critics are wrong. &lt;span&gt;Michael Bay&lt;/span&gt; used a squillion dollars and a hundred supercomputers&amp;#39; worth of CG for a brilliant art movie about the illusory nature of plot. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Since the days of &lt;em&gt;Un Chien Andalou&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, filmmakers have reached beyond meaning. But with this summer's biggest, loudest movie, Michael Bay takes us all the way inside Caligari's cabinet. And once you enter, you can never emerge again. I saw this movie two days ago, and I'm still living inside it. Things are exploding wherever I look, household appliances are trying to kill me, and bizarre racial stereotypes are shouting at me. &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Transformers: ROTF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has mostly gotten pretty hideous reviews, but that's because people don't understand that this isn't a movie, in the conventional sense. It's an assault on the senses, a barrage of crazy imagery. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex had been squatting on the floor last evening, flipping through a big hardcover about knitting. Fine, except he hadn’t picked up when asked (with him it generally takes about three requests, which to be fair is probably about what you’d have to fire at most kids), and I had tripped over this hardcover one too many times. So I tried to cram it back onto the bookshelf just as Jill grabbed her keys and we got ready to head out. Except there was &lt;em&gt;another &lt;/em&gt;book jammed on top of the other books on the shelf, and I had to take it out to get the big knitting hardcover to fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:190px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/06/dawson.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/06/dawson.jpg" alt="Image: paloaltosoftware, flickr.com" width="180" height="240"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: paloaltosoftware, flickr.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Jeff, what are you doing?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Trying to put this book back!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Stop snapping at me viciously!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How would you like me to snap at you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snap we do, and often the root not that Jill and I don’t like each other at that moment, but that we’ve somehow crashed over something Alex did because he’s autistic. Books on the floor, something in the trash, some favor undone or something put somewhere it would be only be put if you didn’t care what your spouse thought or you were trying to put out other fires at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I did it/didn’t do it,” I told Jill once, “not because I don’t care what you think, but because my autistic son was doing something at the time that I had to pay attention to.” What she and I fight, without break, is the inclination to snap at the person who will give us some response: me or Jill, and not Alex. Alex who will react eventually, but not as fast as the spouse will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jill and I had a row like that the other night. I did/didn’t do something, and she snapped, thinking I just didn’t care. “Don’t yell at me for something Alex was responsible for,” I said. “We can’t make it if you do that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s three days later now. For the life of me, I can’t remember now exactly what the problem was.&lt;/p&gt;

In one of the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/the_complaints_department_is_o.php"&gt;comment threads&lt;/a&gt;, some simple suggestions for new commenters have been formulated. They&amp;#39;re pretty good — pay them some heed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you post, even if you intend to reply only to PZ or to one other comment on the 
thread, up to 200 people (or more) will read, and possibly respond to you. Keep this in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As this is a science blog, a greater proportion of the readers and commenters here well-
educated, and, if not scientists, are reasonably well-versed in logic, observation, empiricism, 
debate, and rationality. As such, their responses will likely be pointed, eloquent, articulate, 
and highly opinionated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any comments you make will be judged, and often judged harshly for grammar, intellectual 
consistency, knowledge of the subject addressed, and openness of tone. Get used it; this is 
the deep end, not a wading pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenters who wish to make religious, spiritual, or other arguments are welcome to do 
so, provided they are willing to respond to the observations and criticisms of other posters, 
many of whom are experts in their fields. Commenters who argue without insulting other 
commenters personally or in whole, and who actually respond to counter-arguments will have 
a stimulating time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenters who begin their interaction on this blog with insults (you're a bunch of jerks), 
threats (you're all going to hell) or other poltroonery (atheists have no morals) will be 
responded to in kind by persons who generally have far more experience and education, and 
certainly a greater vocabulary in both insult and invective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;People often say stuff on the Internets that they would never say to your face. You are 
strongly urged to get over it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People do get banned here, although it takes some effort. You can also read my &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/plonk.php"&gt;list of grievances&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to the vociferous commenters already here who will skewer offenders, keep in mind that I rule this place as a casual dictatorship — if I get annoyed, I bring out the axe. All that&amp;#39;s saving some people is that I&amp;#39;m also a lazy tyrant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One other thing I have to add for the regulars: I have a  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/08/a_suggestion_for_the_comments.php"&gt;Three Comment Rule&lt;/a&gt; that I don't really enforce very consistently, but would make for a somewhat less hair-trigger environment. Basically, if someone brand new to you shows up and says something annoying, don't jump down their throat right away. Give them a couple of chances to clarify first, and &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt; if they're  still painfully stupid, open fire with both barrels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/advice_to_new_commenters.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/7BxWTfB5a4E" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245806318247"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1534">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ae62ec15bc863906</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">A head wound from a falling what?</title><published>2009-06-24T00:46:57Z</published><updated>2009-06-24T00:46:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1534" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sitting at San Francsico Airport waiting for my ride (my plane came in half an hour early from London — take that, air travel grumblers!), and beside me is a British Airways cabin crew member waiting for a friend.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005970" title=""&gt;A Fish Eye Out of Water: Ten Visual Opsins in the Four-Eyed Fish, Anableps anableps&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The "four-eyed" fish Anableps anableps has numerous morphological adaptations that enable above and below-water vision. Here, as the first step in our efforts to identify molecular adaptations for aerial and aquatic vision in this species, we describe the A. anableps visual opsin repertoire. We used PCR, cloning, and sequencing to survey cDNA using unique primers designed to amplify eight sequences from five visual opsin gene subfamilies, SWS1, SWS2, RH1, RH2, and LWS. We also used Southern blotting to count opsin loci in genomic DNA digested with EcoR1 and BamH1. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed the identity of all opsin sequences and allowed us to map gene duplication and divergence events onto a tree of teleost fish. Each of the gene-specific primer sets produced an amplicon from cDNA, indicating that A. anableps possessed and expressed at least eight opsin genes. A second PCR-based survey of genomic and cDNA uncovered two additional LWS genes. Thus, A. anableps has at least ten visual opsins and all but one were expressed in the eyes of the single adult surveyed. Among these ten visual opsins, two have key site haplotypes not found in other fish. Of particular interest is the A. anableps-specific opsin in the LWS subfamily, S180γ, with a SHYAA five key site haplotype. Although A. anableps has a visual opsin gene repertoire similar to that found in other fishes in the suborder Cyprinodontoidei, the LWS opsin subfamily has two loci not found in close relatives, including one with a key site haplotype not found in any other fish species. A. anableps opsin sequence data will be used to design in situ probes allowing us to test the hypothesis that opsin gene expression differs in the distinct ventral and dorsal retinas found in this species.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005991" title=""&gt;Melanopsin Bistability: A Fly's Eye Technology in the Human Retina&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In addition to rods and cones, the human retina contains light-sensitive ganglion cells that express melanopsin, a photopigment with signal transduction mechanisms similar to that of invertebrate rhabdomeric photopigments (IRP). Like fly rhodopsins, melanopsin acts as a dual-state photosensitive flip-flop in which light drives both phototransduction responses and chromophore photoregeneration that bestows independence from the retinoid cycle required by rods and cones to regenerate photoresponsiveness following bleaching by light. To explore the hypothesis that melanopsin in humans expresses the properties of a bistable photopigment in vivo we used the pupillary light reflex (PLR) as a tool but with methods designed to study invertebrate photoreceptors. We show that the pupil only attains a fully stabilized state of constriction after several minutes of light exposure, a feature that is consistent with typical IRP photoequilibrium spectra. We further demonstrate that previous exposure to long wavelength light increases, while short wavelength light decreases the amplitude of pupil constriction, a fundamental property of IRP difference spectra. Modelling these responses to invertebrate photopigment templates yields two putative spectra for the underlying R and M photopigment states with peaks at 481 nm and 587 nm respectively. Furthermore, this bistable mechanism may confer a novel form of "photic memory" since information of prior light conditions is retained and shapes subsequent responses to light. These results suggest that the human retina exploits fly-like photoreceptive mechanisms that are potentially important for the modulation of non-visual responses to light and highlights the ubiquitous nature of photoswitchable photosensors across living organisms.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005974" title=""&gt;Stimulus Familiarity Affects Perceptual Restoration in the European Starling (Sturnus vulgaris)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Humans can easily restore a speech signal that is temporally masked by an interfering sound (e.g., a cough masking parts of a word in a conversation), and listeners have the illusion that the speech continues through the interfering sound. This perceptual restoration for human speech is affected by prior experience. Here we provide evidence for perceptual restoration in complex vocalizations of a songbird that are acquired by vocal learning in a similar way as humans learn their language. European starlings were trained in a same/different paradigm to report salient differences between successive sounds. The birds' response latency for discriminating between a stimulus pair is an indicator for the salience of the difference, and these latencies can be used to evaluate perceptual distances using multi-dimensional scaling. For familiar motifs the birds showed a large perceptual distance if discriminating between song motifs that were muted for brief time periods and complete motifs. If the muted periods were filled with noise, the perceptual distance was reduced. For unfamiliar motifs no such difference was observed. The results suggest that starlings are able to perceptually restore partly masked sounds and, similarly to humans, rely on prior experience. They may be a suitable model to study the mechanism underlying experience-dependent perceptual restoration.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005987" title=""&gt;Induction of Empathy by the Smell of Anxiety&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The communication of stress/anxiety between conspecifics through chemosensory signals has been documented in many vertebrates and invertebrates. Here, we investigate how chemosensory anxiety signals conveyed by the sweat of humans (N = 49) awaiting an academic examination are processed by the human brain, as compared to chemosensory control signals obtained from the same sweat donors in a sport condition. The chemosensory stimuli were pooled according to the donation condition and administered to 28 participants (14 males) synchronously to breathing via an olfactometer. The stimuli were perceived with a low intensity and accordingly only about half of the odor presentations were detected by the participants. The fMRI results (event-related design) show that chemosensory anxiety signals activate brain areas involved in the processing of social emotional stimuli (fusiform gyrus), and in the regulation of empathic feelings (insula, precuneus, cingulate cortex). In addition, neuronal activity within attentional (thalamus, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex) and emotional (cerebellum, vermis) control systems were observed. The chemosensory perception of human anxiety seems to automatically recruit empathy-related resources. Even though the participants could not attentively differentiate the chemosensory stimuli, emotional contagion seems to be effectively mediated by the olfactory system.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005996" title=""&gt;Large-Scale Assessment of the Effect of Popularity on the Reliability of Research&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Based on theoretical reasoning it has been suggested that the reliability of findings published in the scientific literature decreases with the popularity of a research field. Here we provide empirical support for this prediction. We evaluate published statements on protein interactions with data from high-throughput experiments. We find evidence for two distinctive effects. First, with increasing popularity of the interaction partners, individual statements in the literature become more erroneous. Second, the overall evidence on an interaction becomes increasingly distorted by multiple independent testing. We therefore argue that for increasing the reliability of research it is essential to assess the negative effects of popularity and develop approaches to diminish these effects.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006024" title=""&gt;No Need to Discriminate? Reproductive Diploid Males in a Parasitoid with Complementary Sex Determination&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Diploid males in hymenopterans are generally either inviable or sterile, thus imposing a severe genetic load on populations. In species with the widespread single locus complementary sex determination (sl-CSD), sex depends on the genotype at one single locus with multiple alleles. Haploid (hemizygous) individuals are always males. Diploid individuals develop into females when heterozygous and into males when homozygous at the sex determining locus. Our comparison of the mating and reproductive success of haploid and diploid males revealed that diploid males of the braconid parasitoid Cotesia glomerata sire viable and fertile diploid daughters. Females mated to diploid males, however, produced fewer daughters than females mated to haploid males. Nevertheless, females did not discriminate against diploid males as mating partners. Diploid males initiated courtship display sooner than haploid males and were larger in body size. Although in most species so far examined diploid males were recognized as genetic dead ends, we present a second example of a species with sl-CSD and commonly occurring functionally reproductive diploid males. Our study suggests that functionally reproductive diploid males might not be as rare as hitherto assumed. We argue that the frequent occurrence of inbreeding in combination with imperfect behavioural adaptations towards its avoidance promote the evolution of diploid male fertility.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006042" title=""&gt;Gender Differences in the Motivational Processing of Babies Are Determined by Their Facial Attractiveness&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This study sought to determine how esthetic appearance of babies may affect their motivational processing by the adults. Healthy men and women were administered two laboratory-based tasks: a) key pressing to change the viewing time of normal-looking babies and of those with abnormal facial features (e.g., cleft palate, strabismus, skin disorders, Down's syndrome and fetal alcohol syndrome) and b) attractiveness ratings of these images. Exposure to the babies' images produced two different response patterns: for normal babies, there was a similar effort by the two groups to extend the visual processing with lower attractiveness ratings by men; for abnormal babies, women exerted greater effort to shorten the viewing time despite attractiveness ratings comparable to the men. These results indicate that gender differences in the motivational processing of babies include excessive (relative to the esthetic valuation) motivation to extend the viewing time of normal babies by men vs. shortening the exposure to the abnormal babies by women. Such gender-specific incentive sensitization phenomenon may reflect an evolutionary-derived need for diversion of limited resources to the nurturance of healthy offspring.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You know &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/for_dedicated_bibliophiles_onl.php"&gt;I mocked&lt;/a&gt; his weird decision to sell an edited version of Darwin's &lt;i&gt;Origin&lt;/i&gt; with a long-winded creationist introduction just this morning…and he&amp;#39;s already edited the ad to &lt;a href="http://www.christiannewswire.com/news/146710758.html"&gt;include a quote from me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's like a book with multiple personality disorder -- two parts that absolutely hate each other; an intro that is the inane product of one of the most stupid minds of our century, and a science text that is the product of one of the greatest minds of the author's century." PZ Myers, biologist and associate professor at the University of Minnesota, Morris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now he has put out a &lt;a href="http://raycomfortfood.blogspot.com/2008/11/request-to-atheists.html"&gt;call for someone to write a foreword&lt;/a&gt; for his very bad anti-atheist book. It seems to me that if he thinks it is appropriate for an idiot creationist to write an introduction to one of the most influential books in science, he needs a similar mismatch for his brain-dead little book…which means he needs a smart atheist to write that foreword.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nics_events/3577991150/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3405/3577991150_42c9908c66_m.jpg" alt="chairs and a podium on a stage, all lined up for a high school graduation. there are no people in the picture, but there are yellow flowers in a vase at the edge of the stage." style="float:right;margin:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The headline: &lt;a href="http://www.rutlandherald.com/article/BT/20090619/NEWS01/906190349/0/WW2"&gt;Court permits autistic teenager to join in graduation&lt;/a&gt;.  Um... what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently an autistic high school senior, who had completed all of the academic requirements necessary for graduation was not going to be allowed to cross the stage because he had not completed his "social and other goals."  Again, um... what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The senior's family had to go to court in order to force the school to allow the teen (who, remember, had completed the all of his academic course work) to participate in graduation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the superintendent Wrend,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Graduation at People's Academy is not a feel-good exercise," Wrend said. "It is the formal recognition that students have met the high standards set for them. We want our graduation ceremonies ... to have meaning."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in what way wouldn't this graduation ceremony have meaning for an autistic teen who completed his course work along with his classmates of the past 9 years?  And since when didn't it "feel good" to finally complete high school?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High school has changed a lot since "my day."  Back then, criteria for graduation, thankfully, did not involve meeting "social goals" else I probably would have needed to go to court in order to be allowed to cross the stage too.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a little unclear here if graduation is intended for the students or for the administrators, and whether school is intended to teach general education or just to point out one's social inadequacies.  The world can be unfriendly enough for us--let us have a moment to "feel good" about what we can, and have, and could accomplish.  Even if it's something like learning calculus instead of small talk.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org&amp;#39;s Autism Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245797934656"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=7843">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8f7e506c24f82c31</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Links elsewhere"/><category term="Skepchick-ism"/><title type="html">Hear Me Say Stuff at 7pm ET!</title><published>2009-06-23T22:30:43Z</published><updated>2009-06-23T22:30:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=7843" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/blog" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=19f731548bcbcb321437c6b20d98bd03&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I recorded an interview with a very nice Canadian fellow named Ethan, host of Radio Freethinkers on CiTR 101.9 in Vancouver.

Even if a child has never received special education services from a public school district, the child is entitled to be reimbursed for tuition to a private school, according to a Supreme Court decision issued yesterday (&lt;a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/08pdf/08-305.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt; of the decision is &lt;a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/08pdf/08-305.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). The Court ruled 6-3 in &lt;em&gt;Forest Grove School District v. T.A.&lt;/em&gt; (Case No. 08-305), as noted in yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2009/06/22/36scotusspecialed.h28.html?tkn=QVUFovfWjVp55hgCFxiEUxsLlHBJBHD9zDVX"&gt;EdWeek&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Consistent with our decisions in [&lt;em&gt;School Committee of] Burlington&lt;/em&gt; [v. &lt;em&gt;Department of Education of Massachusetts&lt;/em&gt;] and [&lt;em&gt;Florence County School District No. 4&lt;/em&gt; v.] &lt;em&gt;Carter&lt;/em&gt;,” Justice Stevens wrote, “we conclude that &lt;a href="http://idea.ed.gov/"&gt;IDEA&lt;/a&gt; authorizes reimbursement for the cost of private special-education services when a school district fails to provide a [free, appropriate public education] and the private-school placement is appropriate, regardless of whether the child previously received special education or related services through the public school.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, advocates for students with disabilities are praising the ruling, while organizations representing school boards and teachers are criticizing the decision for its potential effect on school budgets, keeping the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_costs_of_private_schools"&gt;costs of private schools&lt;/a&gt; in mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it's understandable that parents would not want to place a child with disabilities in a public school program that they deemed inadequate and inappropriate, and therefore seek alternatives (often in the form of a private school). An inappropriate educational program, with not enough staff and/or with staff without the proper training, can potentially create more problems for the student who's not being properly taught, and for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

This one is in the Brainerd Dispatch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to a previous writer's statement " ... modern neo-Darwinian synthesis of organic evolution is supported by more compelling and intellectually satisfying empirical evidence that any other idea ever advanced by the world's scientific community ... "&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The retort to this statement is simple: hogwash! Remember, the neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory is not "change over time" or "modifications through natural selection within an existing species", nor dynamics of cellular metamorphosis. These kinds of actions are simply workings of the natural order and have been observed and recorded for centuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could tell exactly what the writer is about to do at this point. Note that he is responding to a statement of fact, that there is a great deal of empirical evidence in support of evolution. He has announced that that is "hogwash", but is he going to rebut any of the evidence? No, he's going to do a little dance over the word "evolution" and tell us what it isn't. And he's going to get it wrong. Neo-Darwinian theory &lt;i&gt;includes&lt;/i&gt; all of the things he just listed (well, except for &amp;quot;dynamics of cellular metamorphosis&amp;quot; — I don&amp;#39;t even know what that means, and the writer certainly doesn&amp;#39;t, either).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's nice of him to coopt elements of the theory and claim that we've known it all along, though. It's one small step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, science is not synonymous with neo-Darwinism. Neo-Darwinism is in reality a very recent construct. In fact, it was and is being continually cobbled together long after Darwin himself died. Neo-Darwinism in effect says - since there is no pre-planned design behind it - every thing is random and undirected-nothing is planned. There is no purposeful form of life. So human beings, like everything else, is in effect just one of the many possible resulting accidents of an unconscious blind cosmic dice shake. Everything that is came into being as an accident and will disappear someday the same way. Consequently, there is no reason for being, nor any purpose for the natural world, or behavioral norms, and surely there is no rational for a future hope in anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one claims that science is synonymous with neo-Darwinian theory — the physicists and chemists and geologists would be very surprised to learn that they needed to be biologists to be called scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The neo-Darwinian synthesis is less than a hundred years old. No one has been arguing otherwise about that, either. It's also an active theory which is being continually tested, revised, and re-assessed. This is a &lt;i&gt;good thing&lt;/i&gt;: we like to modify our ideas to fit the facts, not vice versa. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, nothing he's said contradicts the claim that evolution is a well-supported theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now we get to the nub of his objections: evolution is unplanned and lacks a long-term purpose. This is both a premise and an inference from the science. We always assume chance is behind variation; that is the null hypothesis. One could charge in, I suppose, and hypothesize that a particular pattern of change is the result of directed meddling, but the best way to test that would be to directly address the mechanism of the intervention. It's not a very productive approach, we've found. We'd have to deduce some of the properties of the agent behind the change, you see, and if we try that, advocates of teleology always back away quickly from any testable proposals. It's been a much more promising approach to postulate an absence of design, make predictions from that, and test them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And voila, it almost always seems to work out well. Predictions that leave out angels, demigods, demons, and magic spells seem to work out quite nicely, so we are left with a powerful theory sans deities, which implies that deities are at least superfluous. That's all the ateleology of biology means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, but notice again: none of his railings have any relevance to the claim of empirical evidence for evolution, that which he calls "hogwash". This isn't an argument, it's an emotional appeal. Many people are uncomfortable with the idea of an absence of guidance, so he's announcing that evolution doesn't include a god, and gee everyone, shouldn't that make you dislike it? But whether we dislike an idea or not has no bearing on its truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially not when our Minnesotan critic then goes on to demonstrate his ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neo-Darwinism's top proponents-Dawkins, Huxley, Weiner, Gould and Dobzhansky are all convinced atheists. For the person who is interested in the subject, but does not want to wade through pages of polemic, or get into deep esoteric scientific reading, might simply go to the video store and ask for Ben Stein's "Expelled" or get a hold of the book "Icons of Evolution" by molecular biologist Jonathan Wells. It might stun you on just how neo-Darwinism is pure fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ron Lindner&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;East Gull Lake&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, let's see. The top proponents are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dawkins: Definitely a top proponent, definitely an atheist. Good start!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Huxley: Well, he &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; a top proponent, but he's dead now. Long dead. He also wasn't an atheist. He was the fellow who coined the word "agnostic"!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Weiner: Who? It took me a moment to figure out who he's talking about, but it must be Jonathan Weiner, the excellent writer behind &lt;i&gt;Beak of the Finch&lt;/i&gt; and other science books. He's more of a science journalist though, a good one. If he's an atheist, he doesn't write about it, and it doesn't come through at all in his books.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Gould: Another top proponent, also an atheist, but also dead. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Dobzhansky: Dobzhansky? One of the most important architects of the neo-Darwinian synthesis, sure, but an atheist? He was Russian Orthodox, and by all accounts, rather devout! He was author of the essay, "Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution", which phrase irks many creationists, but if you actually read the essay, one of its central assertions is that science is not in conflict with his own sincerely held Christianity! This is the guy our writer wants to argue was a nefarious atheist?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do have to give Mr Lindner points for unintentional irony. If you don't like polemics, go watch &lt;a href="http://expelledexposed.com/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Expelled&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;? Right. Don't want to read that science stuff? Then go read Wells. At least I can agree with that last point, since there isn't so much as a scrap of science in that book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm feeling dissatisfied, though. His starting premise was that the body of empirical evidence for evolution was "hogwash", and he seems to have forgotten to actually address the point. Typical.&lt;/p&gt;

They strap a scary big capacitor onto a U.S. quarter and zap it with 15,000 Joules, a truly terrifying amount of energy to pack into a few square centimeters. And what happens when they do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go watch the videos to find out. It’s pretty cool. Interestingly, in the high-speed video, you can see the affect on the coin &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the materials get so hot they incandesce. That means the magnetic field is interacting with the quarter itself before it heats the air, which is not what I expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also clearly hear one of the guys telling people to look away when he trips one of the safety devices. That threw me for a moment. Why look away? Because it’s bright? And then I realized: they are creating a potential of 10,000 Volts, which means they get enough energy density to make &lt;del&gt;X-rays&lt;/del&gt; ultraviolet light. Holy Haleakala. Anyway, watch the setup video as well. &lt;/p&gt;

Today, I asked one of my SciBlings, Greg Laden of the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/" title=""&gt;eponymous blog&lt;/a&gt;, to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Who are you? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was young, I intended to become a priest.  Since I was being raised among Jesuits and Franciscans, that would mean that I would likely be trained as an Inquisitor, and Inquisitors were learned.  So I searched for books to read, and in my household there was one bible written in Ancient German, an Encyclopedia, and a collection of Biology Textbooks.  I read all of them except the Bible because I could not read Ancient German.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that there is a direct line from my youthful training as an Inquisitor to my present job as a Blogger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do you want to do/be when (and if ever) you grow up?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan on being a retired Inquisitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="GregLaden.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/GregLaden.jpg" width="403" height="292" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 20px 0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is your Real Life job?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't talk about my real life job these days  I like to think of myself as an independent scholar and a writer, and a part time blogger. I have a lot of jobs, a lot of stuff I have to do.  But writing, at this moment, is the only thing I want to acknowledge.  Everything else can bite me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good question.  There is absolutely nothing related to science or communication about the web that is interesting. There is only interesting content.  But there is a lot of interest from a technology point of view related to how Web 2.0/the blogosphere/etc works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My interest is mainly in that content. I assume we can do anything with the web, anything related to communication, eventually.  Web 2.0 is baby web.  This will all look so silly even in just a few years. But the need for excellent, accurate, challenging and engaging content is paramount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web allows for communication of the form that has not happened before, but I see the current technology as doing almost as much to interfere with technology as to enhance it. On the user side of things, people in academics tend to be Luddites, wearing their ludditosity as a badge.  These two things -- baby technology and cultural resistance to novelty -- need to change over the short term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Luddites will be left in the dust and Open Source technology will save us all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to the latter, I am very interested in promoting Open Source approaches as the technology of science communication, and Open Access as the structural or editorial milieu for dissemination.  The proprietary models have had their chance and they have stifled rather than enhanced communication.  The party is over, proprietary models! Over!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not mean that there is no room for commercial enterprise and even profit making, but the model that links consumer dollars to production via marketing has got to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social&lt;br&gt;
networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, now we are getting to the serious questions, I see.  Blogging does not relate to my work.  It IS my work.  Blogging is where my voice lives these days.  I've got writing projects that the blogging supports, in terms of my thought process and production stream.  I'm a blogger, not a person who blogs.  Social networks such as, for me mainly, Twitter and Facebook support, point to, enhance, underscore the blogging I do, and provide me with streams of information for my blog.  Facebook in particular is also a social network that serves as a social network (as opposed to something called a social network that serves as a tool for disseminating information).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, Twitter explicitly denies that it is a social network.  This is in writing somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and how did you discover science blogs? What are some of your favourites? Have you discovered any new cool science blogs while at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was at a Minnesota Citizens for Science Education conference and someone mentioned PZ Myers' blog, Pharyngula, as a good thing for life science teachers to read.  I mostly ignored it for a while, because I was not really into reading blogs.  Then I read through a few days worth and thought "Hey, this is a good way to write.  Nice bite size bits, instant feedback, etc" (I don't remember if I actually said "etc" but I might have.)  So I started a blog, and it ran for about 10 months, when I was asked by Scienceblogs Dot Com to join them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think I discovered any new science blogs at the conference because a) I knew about most of them already and b) before the conference I used the conference wiki to find out about more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I did discover is that these blogs are actually written by PEOPLE!!! Who would have thought!?!?!?  One of the great pleasures, for me, which I expected to happen, was to meet some of the bloggers in person.  I was especially looking forward to meeting Coturnix, and I was not disappointed.  There were many others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many things.  Enough that I have to say that this was a very important conference. Much of what I learned came from the inter-session and extra-session conversations, as well as the sessions themselves.  It was also great to meet in person people with whom I've collaborated on line. The organizers and participants in the Transitions session, Gender in Science, Race in Science, and Anonymity sessions produced a sort of Big Giant Stream of Conversation about all of these issues, which are largely related.  There is positive movement here, and a lot of good is happening.  I happen to also think that much of the social theory and political method being used by many of my fellow bloggers is rather mid 20th century and not as effective as it could be, and I would like to see this part of the blogosphere ... well, grow up a bit, to be honest. But that is not true of everyone involved in these important political movements.  And everyone, to a person, is well meaning and is contributing one way or another to the progress that is being made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to the day when I can put up 15 blog postings in a row that have to do with gender and race and have the following two things NOT happen:  1) One or more commenters say "I thought this was a science blog, I'm leaving forever!!!" and 2) One or more fellow bloggers make a side long nasty remark about how my voice is different from theirs, and therefore, wrong.  When those two things happen, or more exactly, don't happen, I'll know we'll have made some advancement in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the ScienceOnline09 conference, because people were meeting face to face, we all were moving more quickly in this direction than we have on the intertubes before or since.  That is important.  The web is wonderful but it is not real life in this very important way.  We need significant cultural evolution to happen in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related, the ScienceOnline09 conference also demonstrated the overlap between science (= fieldwork and test tubes and stuff), politics and society.  That is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of pragmatic aspects of communication covered by the conference, most of which I missed because of the stream of sessions I chose.  They looked good and I heard good things about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also very much appreciated the conversations I had with &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/islandofdoubt/"&gt;James Hrynyshyn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://thebeagleproject.blogspot.com/"&gt;Karen James&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://inversesquare.wordpress.com/"&gt;Tom Levinson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://coralnotesfromthefield.blogspot.com/"&gt;Rick McPherson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogfishx.blogspot.com/"&gt;Mark Powell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/culturedish/"&gt;Rebecca Skloot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse/"&gt;Blake Stacey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://quichemoraine.com/2009/03/gender-trends-in-science-and-medical-writing/"&gt;Karen Venti&lt;/a&gt;, and others at Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Beer Hour and so on. I flew out with my Quiche Moraine Co-blogger, &lt;a href="http://almostdiamonds.blogspot.com/"&gt;Stephanie Zvan&lt;/a&gt; and her husband &lt;a href="http://photography.zvan.net/"&gt;Ben&lt;/a&gt; , and we were very happy to use this as an opportunity to let people know about &lt;a href="http://quichemoraine.com/"&gt;Quiche&lt;/a&gt;.  Also, I was thrilled that &lt;a href="http://crowdedheadcozybed.wordpress.com/"&gt;Lou FCD&lt;/a&gt; came up from the coast for big chunks of the conference, so I could meet my on line buddy in real life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing that surprised me the most, if I may say, is how many people at the conference had been reading the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2008/12/the_zodiac.php"&gt;Congo Memoirs&lt;/a&gt;, and went out of their way to tell me that they liked them! That was nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to meet you and thank you for the interview. I hope&lt;br&gt;
to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pleasure was all mine, and I'll see you in January!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had originally started that last sentence as "there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; some general ways," but as I tried to finish the sentence with a few examples, I wrote and deleted, wrote and deleted, wrote and deleted until I realized that I'm not entirely sure there are any at all.  There are momentary overlaps, some parents share the motivations of some professionals on some things, some professionals share the motivations of some self-advocates on some things, and so on.  Nothing global.  I'm reminded vividly of the paper on &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/professionals_parents_self-advocates_and_social_movements"&gt;professionals, parents, and self-advocates&lt;/a&gt; that broke down some of the core reasons for why the motivations of each group are so often divided or even at odds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's not where it ends either.  Within each group there are also conflicting motives--some professionals want different things for their clients than other professionals.  Some parents want different things for their children than other parents.  And some self-advocates want different things for themselves than other self-advocates.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking about this a lot today. Partly because I think about it always, knowing there is nothing I can post here that won't enrage someone, no matter how innocuous seeming.  But mostly because later this week I'll be attending and presenting at the &lt;a href="http://www.oregonmegaconference.org/index.html"&gt;Oregon Disability Megaconference&lt;/a&gt; which attempts to cater equally to an audience of professionals, parents, and self-advocates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the second year of the Megaconference.  I missed the first year because I was at the &lt;a href="http://aaidd.org"&gt;AAIDD&lt;/a&gt; conference, presenting on something more science than advocacy.  So I'm not sure entirely what to expect.  I do know that the conference format--two or three sessions per day with long breaks in between--is like 500,000,000 times more do-able for me than the typical breakneck schedule (speaking of &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/accessible_meetings"&gt;more accommodating conferences&lt;/a&gt;).  I also do know that there are a number of presentations that are explicitly for a self-advocate audience, and which are being given by (and for) self-advocates and not professionals or parents.  Which bodes well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I don't know however is how that divide will play out.  How many of those autism or child-related presentations would make me enraged?  Or pleased?  Is the presentation on "Understanding Guardianship" going to be one that addresses the issues that are important to self-advocates, or will it be highlighting those things we most adamantly oppose?  Is it even possible to create an event that is for all three audiences without falling into that divide?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how much each group might educate the other, come to understand the point of view of the other, or even work on a daily basis with the other, sometimes I wonder if there might not be some good reasons for that divide. Maybe sometimes the divide should be simply respected rather than attempted to be bridged.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org&amp;#39;s Autism Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245781510437"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1532">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9a788236183c0842</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">TIIIP</title><published>2009-06-23T18:25:11Z</published><updated>2009-06-23T18:25:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1532" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Quoting from the new blog &lt;a href="http://translate4iran.wordpress.com/about-tiip/"&gt;The Translation and Interpretation Intitiative for Iranian Protesters&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

Want to make short movies? Are you also a huge physics dork?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well then, here’s your big chance: &lt;a href="http://www.atlas.ch/contest/"&gt;the folks at the ATLAS experiment at CERN are looking for you&lt;/a&gt;. They’re looking for original media that will help promote ATLAS, the biggest particle experiment being run on the Large Hadron Collider, which I &lt;em&gt;personally&lt;/em&gt; guarantee will not destroy the Earth. If I thought it did, would I help them promote the idea of posting things to YouTube? Hmmm?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if they like what you did better than everyone else’s efforts, they’ll fly you to CERN so you can see the place for yourself! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the idea in their own words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want you to start by showing us your communication and creative skills by producing an original short film or multimedia piece, incorporating material about ATLAS, the biggest experiment on the LHC. The best submissions will be posted on the ATLAS website and YouTube page with full credit to the author, and enter a competition for a paid internship at CERN. The winner will be offered a trip to CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, and given exclusive access to scientists working on the project as well as all the equipment and expertise in CERN’s audiovisual lab. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got that? If they like you best, you get to see the LHC! &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/04/22/europe-day-3-cern-the-lhc/"&gt;I was there last year&lt;/a&gt;, and let me say, it freakin’ rawks. &lt;em&gt;You want to go there&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So get your camcorder or your iPod or whatever you kids are using these days&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy#lhcfootnote"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and make a video plugging particle physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you win, and you go to Geneva, and you go to old town early enough, and the chocolate store isn’t friggin’ closed like it was when I was there leaving me to drool on the window while mere centimeters away from hundreds of kilos of Swiss chocolate, then send me a bar or two, OK? I promise &lt;a href="http://wilwheaton.typepad.com/wwdnbackup/2009/06/what-happens-if-you-feed-a-dog-chocolate-while-he-wears-a-tin-foil-hat-in-the-microwave.html"&gt;I won’t eat it in the microwave while wearing a tin foil hat&lt;/a&gt;, though a variation on that idea might make a good ATLAS video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better get started: the contest ends July 31.&lt;/p&gt;

Two thirds don't believe in gods at all, and &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also emerged six out of ten 10 children (59 per cent) believe that religion "has a negative influence on the world".
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The survey also shows that half of teenagers have never prayed and 16 per cent have never been to church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came to the enlightenment late, so I've been in church. Really, they aren't missing a single thing. Not one thing.

The only problem? The first two words of the headline are obviously wrong, possibly meant to cap another article entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the story in a nutshell: a mysterious man with a St. Bernard is seen around Hingham, and one day only the dog appears, soaking wet and staring soulfully at a lake. Suspecting that the man has gone missing, the police investigate. Since no one knows who the man is, they check a local pet-friendly motel. A woman staying there says she had two visions involving the mysterious man’s demise: one in which  the cops should check the city of Quincy (near a shamrock!) and one in which they should check the woods near the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cops do not check Quincy or its shamrocks since the city is 27 square miles and a third of the population is Irish. They &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; check the woods using cadaver-seeking dogs. They find absolutely nothing.&lt;br&gt;

The only problem? The first two words of the headline are obviously wrong, possibly meant to cap another article entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the story in a nutshell: a mysterious man with a St. Bernard is seen around Hingham, and one day only the dog appears, soaking wet and staring soulfully at a lake. Suspecting that the man has gone missing, the police investigate. Since no one knows who the man is, they check a local pet-friendly motel. A woman staying there says she had two visions involving the mysterious man’s demise: one in which the cops should check the city of Quincy (near a shamrock!) and one in which they should check the woods near the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cops do not check Quincy or its shamrocks since the city is 27 square miles and a third of the population is Irish. They do check the woods using cadaver-seeking dogs. They find absolutely nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

He’s come out swinging in the science/religion debates, taking a hard line against “&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/tag/accommodationism/"&gt;accomodationism&lt;/a&gt;” — the rhetorical strategy on the part of some pro-science people and organizations to paper over conflicts between science and religion so that religious believers can be more comfortable accepting the truth of evolution and other scientific ideas.  &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/05/31/civility-and-the-new-atheists/"&gt;Chris Mooney&lt;/a&gt; and others have taken up the other side, while &lt;a href="http://metamagician3000.blogspot.com/2009/06/noma-no-more-great-accommodationism.html"&gt;Russell Blackford&lt;/a&gt; and others have supported Coyne, and since electrons are free there have been an &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/06/12/the-big-accommodatinism-debate-all-relevant-posts/"&gt;awful lot of blog posts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point I’d like to weigh in on the actual topic of accomodationism, and in particular on what to do about the &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/06/21/fighting-back-against-templeton/"&gt;Templeton Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.  But there is a prior question, which some of the discussion has touched on:  are science and religion actually compatible?  Clearly one’s stance on that issue will affect one’s feelings about accomodationism.  So I’d like to put my own feelings down in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science and religion are not compatible.  But, before explaining what that means, we should first say what it doesn’t mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t mean, first, that there is any &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;logical&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; incompatibility between science and religion.  We shouldn’t declare them to be incompatible purely on the basis of what they are, which some people are tempted to do.  Certainly, science works on the basis of reason and evidence, while religion often appeals to faith (although reason and evidence are by no means absent).  But that just means they are different, not that they are incompatible.  (Here I am deviating somewhat from &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/06/10/rosenhouse-vs-mooney-redux-jason-is-doing-my-job-for-me/"&gt;Coyne’s take&lt;/a&gt;, as I understand it.)  An airplane is different from a car, and indeed if you want to get from Los Angeles to San Francisco you would take either an airplane or a car, not both at once.  But if you take a car and your friend takes a plane, as long as you both end up in San Francisco your journeys were perfectly compatible.  Likewise, it’s not hard to imagine an alternative universe in which science and religion were compatible — one in which religious claims about the functioning of the world were regularly verified by scientific practice.  We can easily conceive of a world in which the best scientific techniques of evidence-gathering and hypothesis-testing left us with an understanding of the workings of Nature which included the existence of God and/or other supernatural phenomena.  (St. Thomas Aquinas, were he alive today, would undoubtedly agree, as would many religious people who &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Physics-Theology-Unexpected-Kinship/dp/0300138407/"&gt;actually are alive&lt;/a&gt;.)  It’s just not the world we live in.  (That’s where they would disagree.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incompatibility between science and religion also doesn’t mean that a person can’t be religious and be a &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/23/science/23Vatican.html?partner=rss&amp;amp;emc=rss"&gt;good scientist&lt;/a&gt;.  That would be a silly claim to make, and if someone pretends that it must be what is meant by “science and religion are incompatible” you can be sure they are setting up straw men.  There is no problem at all with individual scientists holding all sorts of incorrect beliefs, including about science.  There are scientists who believe in the Steady State model of cosmology, or that HIV doesn’t cause AIDS, or that sunspots are the primary agent of climate change.  The mere fact that such positions are held by some scientists doesn’t make them good scientific positions.  We should be interested in what is correct and incorrect, and the arguments for either side, not the particular beliefs of certain individuals.  (Likewise, if science and religion were compatible, the existence of thousands of irreligious scientists wouldn’t matter either.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why science and religion are actually incompatible is that, in the real world, they reach incompatible conclusions.  It’s worth noting that this incompatibility is &lt;strong&gt;perfectly evident&lt;/strong&gt; to any fair-minded person who cares to look.  Different religions make very different claims, but they typically end up saying things like “God made the universe in six days” or “Jesus died and was resurrected” or “Moses parted the red sea” or “dead souls are reincarnated in accordance with their karmic burden.”  And science says:  none of that is true.  So there you go, incompatibility.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the superficial reasonableness of a claim isn’t enough to be confident that it is true.  Science certainly teaches us that reality can be very surprising once we look at it more carefully, and it’s quite conceivable that a more nuanced understanding of the question could explain away what seems to be obviously laid out right in front of us.  We should therefore be a little more careful about understanding how exactly a compatibilist would try to reconcile science and religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, unlike the non-intuitive claims of relativity or quantum mechanics or evolution, which are forced on us by a careful confrontation with data, the purported compatibility of “science” and “religion” is simply a claim about the meaning of those two words.  The favored method of those who would claim that science and religion are compatible — really, the only method available — is to twist the definition of either “science” or “religion” well out of the form in which most people would recognize it.  Often both.&lt;/p&gt;

Aside from the somewhat corny introductions, I was impressed by the quality of Ava’s questions, which clearly showed that she had done her homework before she requested the interviews. I did not notice any comments on the blog, but the Website also features a discussion board that looked well-attended. &lt;/p&gt;

I am speaking of the &lt;a href="http://villagedogs.canmap.org/"&gt;Village Dog Project&lt;/a&gt;, some current research going on that looks very cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the evolution and domestication in dogs requires genetic analysis of a global and diverse panel of non-breed-affiliated village dogs. With a network of worldwide and Cornell-affiliated collaborators, we plan to gather dog samples from remote villages, establish a genetic archive containing DNA and phenotypic information from these dogs, carry out genetic analyses on these samples, and develop computational methods for analyzing this dataset. In particular, we are interested in understanding the location, timing, and demographic conditions underlying domestication; the genetic changes involved in the transition of wolf to dog; the relationship between these village dogs and the breed dogs; and the effect that historical forces have shaped village dog diversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That looks informative and useful, and I'll be looking forward to the publication of the research. That's not what's got me envious, though: for that, you have to look at their field work. The researchers are spending the summer traveling to exotic, remote locations (admittedly, to the kinds of places rife with scavenging village dogs, but &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt;…) to collect blood samples. They have a &lt;a href="http://beak3chimps.blogspot.com/"&gt;travel blog that will be recounting their adventures&lt;/a&gt;, and also explains the science a little more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;After initial domestication, dogs probably lived "breed-less" lives as human commensals (hanging around humans, not really helping or harming them but living off their trash) for many thousands of years. During this time, dog populations quickly expanded and spread across the globe. In the last few hundreds of years, several hundred dog breeds were formed from local dogs in many parts of the world; these breed dogs have entirely replaced the non-breed "indigenous" dogs in some parts of the world, notably in Western Europe and the USA. However, most dogs throughout the world still live their lives as non-breed, indigenous, commensal dogs. We refer to these dogs as "pariah" or "village" dogs. They tend to be smallish (25-40 pounds), often tan, short-haired dogs, though the type varies a bit according to the region you're in. The important point is that these dogs have not undergone the intense genetic bottleneck associated with breed formation. Thus, while breed dogs have only a small subset of the total genetic diversity of all dogs, it is likely that village dogs have a much greater range of the total diversity. Thus, they are very useful for looking at the original domestication event. They are informative of the original genetic bottleneck that led to the formation of domestic dogs many thousands of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmmm. We don't seem to have many dogs running loose around exotic, remote Morris, Minnesota, but there are a few feral cats living off the dumpsters near the grocery store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I probably wouldn't try to read about visiting small midwestern towns to collect cats, though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/visiting_village_dogs.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/Vv7GzODXb_s" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245768594012"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=13795">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c7d2daf6700efc51</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="contest"/><category term="Harvard"/><category term="schwag"/><title type="html">Freakonomics Quiz: Where Does the Harvard Class of 1989 Live Now?</title><published>2009-06-23T14:45:18Z</published><updated>2009-06-23T14:45:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/23/freakonomics-quiz-where-does-the-harvard-class-of-1989-live-now/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/" type="html">I could find nine people from my class who are  famous/semi-famous/infamous.

&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;I played them a recording of the "last words" of the &lt;a href="http://www.linguistics.unimelb.edu.au/research/jiwarli/index.html"&gt;Jiwarli language of Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;.  After some questioning looks I explained that this language is now dead, and we were listening to its last speaker before he died.  As one they all looked down, shaking their heads in disbelief and saying &lt;em&gt;sorry, sorry, sorry…&lt;/em&gt;.  It was as if I told them a mutual friend had died.  They urged me to put that recording on a cassette tape so they could take it back to their village.  That way, everyone would surely understand what will happen to the Usarufa language unless there are serious attempts to revitalize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;I wasn't prepared for the intensity of their response.  Now I'm wondering if a collection of such recordings might be a useful tool in promoting language revitalization, and also in explaining the concept of language archiving.  (Thanks to Ima'o Ta'asata, James Warebu, Sivini Ikilele, and Waks Mark for their dedication to the preservation of Usarufa oral culture, and to Aaron Willems and SIL-PNG for facilitating this work.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As dictated by the Streisand Effect — making a stink about something trivial will itself turn it into big news — people all over the world are now talking about &amp;quot;alternative medicine&amp;quot; and its unhealthy dose of quackery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That includes my dear friends the skeptics in Australia, who have been relentlessly and heroically pounding the altmed movement Down Under. The latest shot is against the very thing the BCA is talking about: &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2009/06/21/australian-chiropractor-claims-to-be-able-to-treat-colic/"&gt;chiropractors inflating their credentials and making claims not at all based on solid evidence&lt;/a&gt;. Check out that link, poke around the website, and show Dr. Rachie (a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; doctor, folks) your love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s more: you may have heard of Daniel Hauser, a young boy who has Hodgkin’s lymphoma. His parents don’t &amp;quot;believe&amp;quot; in real medicine and were treating him with nonsense therapies like using herbs and vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a hint, people: you don’t get to choose to not believe in medicine, just like you don’t get to choose to not believe in gravity. You can &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; believe in either all you want, but when the time comes, your belief may kill you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A judge agrees: &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/06/20/chemotherapy-helps-daniel-hauser-what-do-his-parents-say-now/"&gt;he issued a court order to the family&lt;/a&gt; to make them have Daniel undergo chemotherapy. And guess what? &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/06/18/hauser.alternative.cancer.treatment/index.html"&gt;His tumor is shrinking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if you’re familiar with the zealot-like belief system some people have in altmed, the next bit won’t surprise you at all: his family claims that it’s not the chemotherapy shrinking the tumor, it’s their altmed supplements. Yes, even though for months their &amp;quot;treatment&amp;quot; did no good at all, and after a few sessions of chemo the tumor shrank, of course it was the vitamins that did the trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know what? It would make me sad, but if, as an adult, and after doing due diligence to research a problem, you decide to take vitamins to cure a fatal disease, that’s your choice. But when it comes to your kids things are different. You can choose to dress them funny, or give them terrible haircuts, and even choose what religion they will be and how they will be educated. &lt;em&gt;But you don’t get to choose to kill them&lt;/em&gt;. And when there is evidence — rock-solid and with thousands of examples — that your idea of medicine is quackery, and that withholding of real medicine will let your child die, your rights as a parent have been abrogated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a parent, that’s a hard thing for me to write. You may say, what if the government wants to take your kid away for what you feel is a capricious reason? The difference here, the critical difference, is that &lt;strong&gt;this isn’t capricious&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s based on solid evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you decide to sacrifice your child upon an altar to Zeus, or tie them to railroad tracks to cleanse their chi, or &lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2009/06/18/2009-06-18_queens_mother_marie_lauradin_charged_in_voodoo_fire_ritual_that_leaves_6yearold_.html"&gt;set your little girl on fire&lt;/a&gt; to purify her of demons, then guess what? The State has a right to step in to protect that child. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right to swing your beliefs ends at a child’s nose. The problem is, far, far too many people think their beliefs are untouchable rights. &lt;em&gt;They’re not&lt;/em&gt;. And those of us in the reality-based community will continue to pursue this as long as people who aren’t based there continue to hurt their kids.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245762683885"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/06/beowulf_saves_the_royal_pub.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e5f27487f07f6beb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Archaeology"/><title type="html">Beowulf Saves the Royal Pub</title><published>2009-06-23T13:20:03Z</published><updated>2009-06-23T13:20:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/DRJv5gTeMfU/beowulf_saves_the_royal_pub.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/upload/2009/06/beowulf_saves_the_royal_pub/180px-Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg" width="180" height="286" alt="180px-Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg"&gt;I'm finishing writing a book and you guys will have the opportunity to review the manuscript some time towards late summer. The working title is &lt;i&gt;Mead-halls of the Eastern Geats. Elite Settlements and Political Geography AD 375-1000 in Östergötland, Sweden.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title alludes to the Old English epic poem about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf"&gt;Beowulf&lt;/a&gt;. Set mainly in 6th century Denmark, it is all about the petty kings of the time whose political life was centred upon the feasting hall. That's where raids were planned, guests entertained, loot from raids shared out, religious rituals performed, epic poetry about raids listened to. Without a mead-hall, an armed retinue, a high-born wife, a court poet and a big chest of gold, nobody could be a king. The conflict that drives the first two thirds of the long poem is centred upon certain problems King Hrothgar of the Danes has with his mead-hall "The Hart". It is being haunted by a bloodthirsty marsh ghoul named Grendel, and while this goes on Hrothgar is unable to function as a king. Who ya gonna call? Hrothgar calls the ghostbusting superhero Beowulf from Götaland (land of the Geatas, in Old English) to take care of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the other day I was sitting on the gold chest in my hall talking to my high-born wife while the retinue was drinking mead and listening to this long poem about me. My wife is a journalist, and I received her along with a serious haul of gold back when I swore fealty to the Chairman-Emperor of China. She is my main contact with the real world where people have 9-5 jobs, watch TV and follow the news. And when I mentioned the title of the manuscript to her, it turned out that the beowulfian references an Early Medieval scholar takes for granted are completely lost on people from the modern world. "Eastern Geats" she could guess meant something about Östergötland. That's after all where I've done most of my fieldwork in recent years. But "mead-hall" she interpreted, in analogy with Sw. &lt;i&gt;ölhall&lt;/i&gt; and Ge. &lt;i&gt;Bierhalle&lt;/i&gt;, to mean "pub". So, outside the book's main audience of people who take an interest in 1st Millennium Scandinavia, I'm apparently completing a work named "Guide to the Pubs of the Linköping Area".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/06/beowulf_saves_the_royal_pub.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/DRJv5gTeMfU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245760659577"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/why_scientific_medicine_just_cant_win.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9ecd712997f311b3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Why scientific medicine just can't win in testimonials</title><published>2009-06-23T13:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-06-23T13:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/zFfqJGJeqLU/why_scientific_medicine_just_cant_win.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the last month or so, I've written numerous posts about &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062%3Auyrcvn__yd0&amp;amp;q=daniel+Hauser+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Finsolence%2F&amp;amp;sa=Search"&gt;Daniel Hauser&lt;/a&gt;. Danny, as you recall, is the 13-year-old Minnesota boy who was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma back in February, underwent one round of chemotherapy for it, and then decided that he wanted to pursue quackery instead of more chemotherapy. His mother supported his decision and justified it by appealing to a faux Native American religion known as Nemenhah, which is, in reality, nothing more than an excuse for its originator, a wannabe who named himself Chief Cloudpiler, to sell quackery under the guise of "Native American" medicine. Ultimately, his mother Colleen Hauser's and his refusal to undergo chemotherapy led to child protective services reporting the family. Legal hearings ensued, and the judge ordered the Hausers to make sure that Daniel underwent appropriate therapy for his cancer. Unfortunately, Daniel's mother took him on the lam from the law. Fortunately, they were only gone a couple of days before Colleen turned herself (and Danny) in to the law. When &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/danny_hausers_doing_well_and_as_usual_mi.php"&gt;last we met Daniel&lt;/a&gt;, a friend was reporting that he had undergone chemotherapy and that his tumors were shrinking, a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/06/18/hauser.alternative.cancer.treatment/index.html"&gt;CNN weighed in&lt;/a&gt;, confirming that Daniel is indeed doing well. However, the story also happened to be one of the rare instances where I've seen in the mainstream press where a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/05/understanding_alternative_medi_1.php"&gt;concept that I've emphasized&lt;/a&gt; since the very beginning of this blog was illustrated so well: Namely that, when an alt-med believer undergoes both standard, science-based therapy and an "alternative medicine," he always attributes any improvement to the woo, not the standard therapy. Always. Unfortunately, the story was far too credulous and did not point this principle out.

Jury Announcement
In August 2006 the Irish company Steorn published an advertisement in the Economist announcing the development of “a technology that produces free, clean and constant energy”. Qualified experts were sought to form a “jury” to validate these claims.
Twenty-two independent scientists and engineers were selected by Steorn to form this [...]</summary><author><name>Ben Goldacre</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscience.net/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscience.net/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscience.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245757407642"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/for_dedicated_bibliophiles_onl.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/52077da84a06520c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Books"/><title type="html">For dedicated bibliophiles only</title><published>2009-06-23T12:20:21Z</published><updated>2009-06-23T12:20:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/QellL55u9JE/for_dedicated_bibliophiles_onl.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;What a deal. For only 99¢, you can get an abridged version of Charles Darwin&amp;#39;s &lt;i&gt;On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life&lt;/i&gt;; you can tell it's been abridged because the title has been reduced to  &lt;a href="http://www.livingwaters.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=383"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Origin of Species&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s also special because it contains a 50 page introduction by Ray Comfort, which tells you everything that the creationists are sure is wrong about the rest of the book. It&amp;#39;s like a book with multiple personality disorder — two parts that absolutely hate each other, an intro that is the inane product of one of the most stupid minds of our century, and a science text that is the product of one of the greatest minds of the author&amp;#39;s century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait! For only $3.99, you can also get a copy of &lt;a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/PublicStore/product/Charles-Darwin-Bible-The-HCSB,5980,227.aspx"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Charles Darwin Bible&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is the only Bible in existence to mention DNA, the Cambrian, mutations, peppered moths, etc. And it includes "In-text study notes written specifically for atheists"! Unfortunately, Charles Darwin had nothing at all to do with this Bible; it's actually the product of Answers in Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm tempted to get copies of each. They look like beautiful examples of creationist "thought".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/for_dedicated_bibliophiles_onl.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/QellL55u9JE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245757011385"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1530">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6191273797daefc4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Ignorance of Linguistics"/><category term="Language change"/><title type="html">Annals of Passivity</title><published>2009-06-23T11:36:53Z</published><updated>2009-06-23T11:36:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1530" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;We've noted, &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/index.php?s=passive+voice"&gt;more than once&lt;/a&gt;, that the grammatical meaning of "passive voice" is &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1227"&gt;pretty much dead&lt;/a&gt; in popular usage, while the ordinary-language meaning, struggling to be born, remains inchoate, a sludgy mixture of dessicated grammatical residues and vaguely sexualized associative goo. Sometimes &lt;em&gt;passive&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;voice &lt;/em&gt;is used to mean "vague about who's at fault", which seems to be the grammatical sense gone adrift; sometimes it means "listless, energyless, lacking in vigor", which is one of the more general, non-grammatical senses of &lt;em&gt;passive&lt;/em&gt;; sometimes it seems to mean "on the fence, not taking sides", which is a sort of transmuted combination of the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I've come across several additional pieces for the collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.racheltoor.com/Bio.html"&gt;Rachel Toor&lt;/a&gt;, "&lt;a href="http://www.racheltoor.com/LATimesReview.html"&gt;&amp;#39;F5′ by Mark Levine&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;LA Times&lt;/em&gt;, 7/22/2007:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;When writing about nature it makes sense to use &lt;strong&gt;the passive voice&lt;/strong&gt;. Things             happen. It's hard to attribute agency, unless you do it on a grand scale             (deity) or a chaotic physical scale (the "butterfly effect" of nonlinear             dynamics, which posits that the flapping of tiny wings can trigger a             tornado). But it's tempting to personify, to impute intent. Poets, novelists             and playwrights have long used weather to create a mood. Dark and stormy             nights do not auger well. Happy endings are often in lambent light.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the phrase "passive voice" is clearly intended as a grammatical term, or at least as a characterization of how sentences are put together; but equally clearly, it means "vague about agency".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rachel Toor, "&lt;a href="http://chronicle.com/jobs/news/2009/06/2009060901c.htm"&gt;Writing Like a Doctor&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Chronicle of Higher Education&lt;/em&gt;, 6/9/2009:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Whenever I ask Godfrey to explain his medical and scientific work to me — something I do frequently — I am captivated. He has the ability to get at the most interesting issues, to draw out the implications of what he's studying, and to explain them in ways that are fascinating. He knows how to tell a story in conversation. He knows which details will enhance suspense, which will come as a surprise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;But when it comes to putting it on the page, those skills desert him. He writes in &lt;strong&gt;simple, declarative, passive sentences&lt;/strong&gt;. He endlessly repeats words and phrases. His language is complicated not only by terms of medical and scientific art, but by using unnecessary Latinate words when plain old Anglo-Saxon ones would do a better job. He has no idea how commas and paragraph breaks can be your friends, doesn't understand that adverbs are the refuge of the weak and lazy, and that semicolons, like loaded guns, should only be handled by those trained to use them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given its local context, &lt;em&gt;passive&lt;/em&gt; here again seems to be a description of how sentences are put together; but it seems to contrast with the just-mentioned "ways that are fascinating" and "details [that] will enhance suspense", and thus to mean something like "dull, lacking in vigor".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.iie.com/staff/author_bio.cfm?author_id=586"&gt;Simon Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, "&lt;a href="http://baselinescenario.com/2009/06/18/too-big-to-fail-politically"&gt;Too Big To Fail, Politically&lt;/a&gt;", 6/18/2009 (emphasis added):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;What is the essence of the problem with our financial system – what  brought us into deep crisis, what scared us most in September/October  of last year, and what was the toughest problem in the early days of  the Obama administration?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;[…] The problem was: a relatively small number of troubled banks were so large that their failure could imperil both our financial system and the world economy. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;But instead of defining this core problem, explaining its origins,  emphasizing the dangers, and addressing it directly, what do we get in  yesterday’s 101 pages of &lt;a href="http://documents.nytimes.com/obama-s-plan-for-financial-regulatory-reform#p=1"&gt;regulatory reform proposals&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt; A passive voice&lt;/strong&gt; throughout the explanation of what happened (e.g., &lt;a href="http://documents.nytimes.com/obama-s-plan-for-financial-regulatory-reform/page/12#p=20"&gt;this preamble&lt;/a&gt;).  No one did anything wrong and banks, in particular, are absolved from all responsibility for what has transpired.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is clearly the "vague about who's at fault" meaning. Just to verify that Prof. Johnson is not using the term in its technical grammatical sense, let's take a look at &lt;a href="http://documents.nytimes.com/obama-s-plan-for-financial-regulatory-reform/page/12#p=20"&gt;the allegedly passive-voice preamble passage&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;In the years leading up to the current financial crisis, risks &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;built up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; dangerously in our  financial system. Rising asset prices, particularly in housing, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;concealed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; a sharp  deterioration of underwriting standards for loans. The nation's largest financial firms,  already highly leveraged, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;became increasingly dependent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;on unstable sources of short-  term funding. In many cases, weaknesses in firms' risk-management systems &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;left them  unaware &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;of the aggregate risk exposures on and off their balance sheets. A credit boom  &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;accompanied&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;a housing bubble. Taking access to short-term credit for granted, firms &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;did  not plan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for the potential demands on their liquidity during a crisis. When asset prices  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;started to fall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and market liquidity &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;froze&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, firms &lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;were forced to pull back&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from lending,  limiting credit for households and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Our supervisory framework &lt;span style="color:#ff00ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;was not equipped&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to handle a crisis of this magnitude. To be  sure, most of the largest, most interconnected, and most highly leveraged financial firms  in the country &lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;were subject to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; some form of supervision and regulation by a federal  government agency. But those forms of supervision and regulation &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;proved inadequate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;First, capital and liquidity requirements &lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;were simply too low&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Regulators &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;did not require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; firms to hold sufficient capital to cover trading assets, high-risk loans, and off-balance  sheet commitments, or to hold increased capital during good times to prepare for bad  times. Regulators &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;did not require&lt;/strong&gt; firms&lt;/span&gt; to plan for a scenario in which the availability of  liquidity &lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;was sharply curtailed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Second, on a systemic basis, regulators &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;did not take into account&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; the harm that large,  interconnected, and highly leveraged institutions &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;could inflict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on the financial system and  on the economy if they &lt;strong&gt;failed&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Third, the responsibility for supervising the consolidated operations of large financial  firms &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;span&gt;was split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; among various federal agencies. Fragmentation of supervisory  responsibility and loopholes in the legal definition of a "bank" &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;allowed&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;owners of banks  and other insured depository institutions to shop for the regulator of their choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Fourth, investment banks &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;operated&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;with insufficient government oversight. Money  market mutual funds &lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;were vulnerable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to runs. Hedge funds and other private pools of  capital &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;operated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; completely outside of the supervisory framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its 23 tensed verbs include &lt;span&gt;16 &lt;strong&gt;actives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;3 &lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;copulas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;1 &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff00ff"&gt;adjectival passive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span&gt;3 &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;true passives&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. (Or maybe 2+2, I'm not sure about "split"). 13-17% passive is roughly typical of such writing (though far below the &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003414.html"&gt;35-70% passive voice&lt;/a&gt; found in exponents of old-fashioned authorial vigor like Winston Churchill), and certainly doesn't deserve the description "(grammatical) passive voice throughout". (We could also count the distribution of grammatical valency among infinitives and participles, but the results would not be very different.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/blog/"&gt;Peter Seibel&lt;/a&gt;, who sent me the link to Johnson&amp;#39;s article, noted Johnson&amp;#39;s use of the indefinite article — &amp;quot;in a passive voice&amp;quot;, like &amp;quot;in a hoarse voice&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;in an authoritative voice&amp;quot; — and speculates that &amp;quot;Maybe […] people will start  talking about &amp;#39;a passive voice&amp;#39; when they mean lacking in agency and  &amp;#39;the passive voice&amp;#39; can be reclaimed as a grammatical term&amp;quot;. But I doubt that the definite/indefinite distinction can bear that much additional weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semantic evolution is normal and inevitable, and the result is often a panoply of senses diverging so broadly that their relationship becomes obscure. Thus &lt;em&gt;panoply&lt;/em&gt; originally came from a Greek word meaning "full armor", and has taken on meanings that include (quoting the OED) "A spiritual or psychological protection or defence" (from Ephesians 6:11); "A complete suit of armour, with connotations of brightness and splendour"; "Any complete covering or protective layer";  "A group of pieces of armour arranged as a trophy or ornament"; "A splendid or impressive array; fine or magnificent display"; and "&lt;em&gt;fig.&lt;/em&gt; A full or extensive array of resources; a wide range or array &lt;em&gt;(of)&lt;/em&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things are more complicated when one of a word's senses is a  term of art in some well-established field whose scope overlaps in everyday life with the word's ordinary-language uses. This applies to many legal terms and to some physical, chemical, and biomedical ones. But in the case of grammatical terms, something additional and unusual has happened:  a large class of professionals, who act like maintainers of a body of technical knowledge, have actually lost the thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's as if nurses, as a class, had never learned that &lt;em&gt;fever&lt;/em&gt; is a technical term for abnormally high measurements of body temperature, and instead used it variously to mean "A state of intense nervous excitement" or "Contagious but transient social enthusiasm", while still acting as if these were well-defined medical conditions, subject to exact measurement and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this scenario is doubly impossible, because most people know the technical meaning of &lt;em&gt;fever&lt;/em&gt;, or at least how to quantify body temperature with a thermometer, and nurses are required to have a sound medical education.  But writing teachers and analysts of style are not required or even encouraged to learn any grammar (or &lt;a href="http://chronicle.com/jobs/news/2009/06/2009061801c.htm?utm_source=at&amp;amp;utm_medium=en"&gt;any other body of knowledge, alas&lt;/a&gt;), though most of them still use terms like "passive voice" and "adverb" as if they had a well-defined technical meaning. And few members of the general public know enough to notice the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, most people fall into a state that Geoff Pullum has described as "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1357"&gt;nervous cluelessness&lt;/a&gt;", brought on "by confusing and confused instructions about writing that give them vague unease instead of a sense of mastery".&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245756425888"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=562">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/10691c0ae8aa035e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Pseudoscience"/><category term="Neuroscience"/><title type="html">Phrenology - History of a Science and Pseudoscience</title><published>2009-06-23T11:00:57Z</published><updated>2009-06-23T11:00:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=562" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;When first introduced in 1796, phrenology was the latest advancement in the field of neurology.  It was widely accepted, even welcomed, by many practicing neurologists as a powerful diagnostic tool. Phrenologists were even on the winning side of an important scientific debate concerning a central concept of brain anatomy and function. As more scientific methods began to take hold within medicine, however, and the secrets of the brain began to yield to more careful investigation, phrenology became increasingly marginalized.   By the early 20th century the last vestiges of phrenology were gone from scientific medicine and mainstream neurology, but not gone completely.  Phrenology survives to this day as a classic pseudoscience, with dedicated adherents convinced of its efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The history of phrenology, and the story of its modern believers, is a classic one in the history of pseudoscience.  To contemporary skeptics, the claims of phrenology sound no different than any wacky belief system.  Believers claim to be able to read an individual’s personality, their strengths and weaknesses, hopes and desires, by examining the pattern of bumps on their skull.  At first the idea sounds no different, and no less ridiculous, than treating liver disease by rubbing the foot, or diagnosing heart disease by the pattern of colors in the iris.  It isn’t, but phrenology has a very different origin than reflexology or iridology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand phrenology, we must begin with the central debate of neurological scientists of the 18th and 19th centuries.  The question concerned the organization of the brain.  One school believed that the brain was relatively homogenous, the entire brain worked together as a whole to produce all mental and motor functions.  One particular function, therefore, such as humor, aggression, the ability to control the right hand, or recognize the scent of a rose, could not be localized to any piece of the brain.  Trying to identify what any one part of the brain did, therefore, was useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other school believed the exact opposite, that the brain was exquisitely compartmentalized. Every function that can be attributed to the brain could, they argued, be localized to a particular part of the brain, which was dedicated to that single function alone. To this latter school, understanding the brain would come through identifying which pieces were responsible for which functions. This hypothesis was initially proposed and championed in 1796 by Austrian physician &lt;a href="http://www.phrenology.com/franzjosephgall.html"&gt;Franz Joseph Gall&lt;/a&gt; (1758-1828). (Gall, 1796)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gall’s notions were first explored further by &lt;a href="http://www.cerebromente.org.br/n01/frenolog/frenloc.htm"&gt;neurophysiologist Pierre Flourens&lt;/a&gt;, who in the 1800s followed up on Gall’s work with a series of experiments on rabbits and pigeons. He found that coordination localized to the cerebellum, while basic functions like respirations localized to the brainstem. However, he could not localize higher cortical functions, like memory, and so concluded that while primitive neurological functions did localize to one part of the brain, the higher cognitive functions were diffuse in the cerebral hemispheres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flourens was wrong, and this probably has something to do with the fact that he was studying rabbits and pigeons, making it difficult to assess cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pierre Paul Broca then took this research further, using clinical evaluations of humans to see if specific mental functions could be localized to specific brain tissue, and he was very successful in his research. One part of the cortex in the dominant frontal lobe is now called Broca’s area in his honor - this brain structure serves the specific function of translating language into the motor function of speech. Damage to this area results in what is called a Broca’s aphasia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Broca’s contributions to neuroscience the scientific community had largely settled on the compartmentalist view of the brain. The phrenologists belonged to this school from the beginning - they were compartmentalists.  But what does this have to do with bumps on the skull?  To get there we have to add another principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phrenologists argued that the parts of the brain which corresponded to functions that an individual used a great deal would hypertrophy (grow larger), while those functions which were neglected would atrophy (shrink). The brain, they argued, was like muscle – those muscles which are exercised frequently bulked up, while those that are not used remain small and even shrink.  Their vision of the brain, therefore, was that it had a lumpy and bulbous surface, with a landscape unique to each individual based upon their particular set of intellectual and neurological strengths and weaknesses. They further argued that the skull overlying the lumpy parts of the brain would bulge out to accommodate the hypertrophied brain tissue underneath.  Therefore, by measuring those bumps, we can infer which parts of the brain are enlarged and therefore which characteristics are dominant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the middle of the 19th century, phrenology machines were in widespread use.  The automated machines were composed of numerous spring-loaded probes.  The device was placed over the head while the probes would extend to gently touch the scalp, thereby providing a measurement of the topography of the skull.  The machine would then calculate the characteristics of the subject based upon this topography and produce an automated reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, Gall and the phrenologists were correct when it came to the central debate of neurology of the time.  The brain is compartmentalized, with each piece serving a specific function.  The modern map of the brain, however, does not correlate to the classic map used by phrenologists.  Theirs was more personality based, while the modern map is based on fundamental functions, such as the ability to perform mathematical calculations or interpret language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least this simple model of a compartmentalized brain is true when it comes to basic cognitive functions - such as language, motor control, vision, etc. However, for the higher cognitive functions, such as reality testing, decision making, inhibition of impulses, and similar functions - there is still a significant debate about the big picture of brain organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today the debate is between modules and networks - do specific anatomical brain modules produce specific cognitive functions, or are these function dependent upon a network of connections among various brain regions with any individual region participating in multiple networks simultaneously. I go into more detail about this debate here, but the bottom line is that the answer is likely to be a combination of the two models - brain modules that are wired for specific types of processing, but participating in different networks for specific functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the phrenologists got the compartmentalism thing mostly right, but all of the other assumptions of phrenology are mostly false.  The brain is not, after all, a muscle.  It does not hypertrophy or atrophy depending on use.  The brain does change with use (a property called plasticity), but the changes occur on a microscopic level, and have to do with the strength and density of neural pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that the amount of gray matter that is dedicated to a task will increase with use of that task and is larger, as a proportion of brain tissue, in people with talent and skill in a specific area. Musicians have more gray matter dedicated to music, mathematical relationships, and motor control of the hands, than do non-musicians.  This effect is only seen when we look at the internal structure of the brain with functional imaging - how much of the brain lights up when we perform a task. It does not affect the overall size and shape of the brain, and bits of the brain do not bulge out with use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the brain is very jelly-like in consistency. The soft brain conforms to the shape of the skull, even in severe cases of cranial deformity due to disease or the bindings which are practiced in some cultures. The skull does not conform itself to the brain. The notion of bone changing shape in reaction to underlying pressure is actually reasonable - bone is plastic and will reform to accommodate pressure. Brain tissue, however, is simply not capable of producing such pressure. Some types of brain tumor, on the other hand, are and often changes in the skull seen on X-ray can be a clue to an underlying tumor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientific debate underlying phrenology was addressed over 100 years ago, and answered definitively.  While some of the underlying concepts are true or at least reasonable, to a degree, the ultimate conclusion of phrenologists - that the bumps on the skull could be used to divine personality - turned out to be false. Modern neuroscience now far surpasses the preliminary knowledge on which the hypothesis of phrenology was based, and our contemporary perspective allows us to conclude with the highest degree of scientific certitude that two of the key assumptions of phrenology are incorrect, and in fact phrenology does not work. How then is it possible for belief in phrenology to persist?  Frequent readers of this blog will likely suspect the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phrenology and Cold Reading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the final analysis, practicing phrenologists were and still are using a method known as &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=263"&gt;cold reading&lt;/a&gt;. Briefly, cold reading is the technique of making general statements about a target subject, statements which are likely to be somewhat true about almost any human being.  In a dynamic cold reading, such as a psychic reading, subconscious feedback from the client is then used to make more and more specific statements, by pursuing the more accurate statements, the hits, and ignoring the misses.  The results can seem very impressive, but the technique is actually quite simple once it is understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cold reading can also be done, however, in a static fashion.  In such cold readings, a limited set of pre-written statements concerning the subject are chosen according to some method. This can be done by making an astrological chart, handwriting analysis, or undergoing phrenological analysis. The pre-written statements, as with the opening statements of a dynamic cold reading, are designed to be vague and universal, so that anyone could see themselves to some degree in the statements.  Readings such as “You like to be admired by others,” “At times you do not pay close enough attention to details,” or “You tend to feel more affection than you express to others,” are likely to strike a cord of recognition in all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most advanced expression of phrenology was the automated phrenology machine, which automatically measured the bumps on the subject’s skull, then produced a set of statements which were selected from 160 different possibilities, printed on small pieces of ticker tape and produced from the machine. I call this the “fortune cookie” style of cold reading. Phrenologists today also perform a more dynamic form of cold reading, by directly reading the bumps on a client’s skull while actively interpreting the results, allowing for the process of feedback and refinement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to see how such elaborate lists of correlations (palm creases with personality traits, and iris flecks with diseases) come into being.  Some appear to have been made up out of whole cloth.  Others are based upon a small set of uncontrolled observations, which are then presented as scientific evidence.  This was the case for phrenology. Gall, in fact, developed his hypothesis initially after measuring the contours of the skulls of several family members and friends.  He believed he detected certain patterns of bumps and personality traits in these individuals, and developed his theory of phrenology from this preliminary data.  Gall then went on to develop the elaborate phrenological chart from this information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gall made a classic mistake in his methods - functionally he engaged in data mining and then assumed that the patterns he saw reflected underlying reality rather than random chance. He did not appreciate the fact that even if phrenology were completely wrong, he would still find correlations between the skulls of his subjects and their personality. He did not validate the apparent patterns he found with fresh data - by using the original observations to make predictions and then testing those predictions. He was not adequately skeptical of his own conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a time, Gall’s work enjoyed prestige among the intellectual elite of Europe, who were just embracing the ideals of science and rationalism.  His apparent systematic and scientific approach to the topic of human personality appealed to the rationalists of his time. It is likely that confirmation bias (a tendency to find confirming data and ignore or dismiss disconfirming data) reinforced his belief and confidence in his new system of phrenology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As early as 1808, however, phrenology was already coming under scientific criticism. The Institute of France assembled a committee of savants,  led by Cuvier, to investigate phrenology, and they concluded that it had no scientific basis. (Sabbatini, 1997)  Over the ensuing years, scientists were unable to duplicate under more rigorous scientific conditions the phrenological charts made by Gall, and phrenology had failed a key test of true science, reproducibility.  If the precepts of phrenology were correct, then any scientist in any lab could reproduce Galls chart through objective analysis of skull bumps and personality. It turns out, they couldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How, then, do believers defend their belief in phrenology, astrology, palmistry, iridology, or other such pseudoscience?  Often the answer is simply, “I have seen it work.”  They believe they have seen the method they employ work, and therefore the underlying principles must be true, no matter how much they appear to contradict established science. What true believers in such pseudosciences fail to appreciate is the basic skeptical principle that people are easily deceived, especially by themselves.  The illusion of accuracy produced by cold reading often fools not only the client, but the reader as well, reinforced by each client who gushes over how accurate the readings were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This principle is convincingly demonstrated by a &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/safarchive/3_ask/archive/qna/3282_rhyman.html"&gt;classic tale told by psychologist and CSI fellow, Ray Hyman&lt;/a&gt;.  As a youth he took up the practice of palmistry to make some extra money.  He did not really believe in palm reading, but was amazed at the apparent accuracy of his readings, simply by following, cook book style, the formula in a standard handbook of palmistry. Before long he was convinced of palmistry’s fantastic power to penetrate the deepest secrets of his clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Ray Hyman also had a scientific curiosity, an apparent rarity among palm readers.  He decided to conduct a simple experiment to test the efficacy of palm reading.  He began giving his clients the exact opposite reading as dictated by the handbook.  To his surprise, his clients still claimed that his readings were amazingly accurate and were pleased with the results, to no less degree than when the “correct” readings were given. Dr. Hyman had discovered the power of cold reading and confirmation bias which lay behind palmistry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modern Phrenology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazingly, phrenology persists to this day as a pseudoscientific form of divination.  It is marginalized, and has no presence in mainstream science, but it persists none-the-less. There is, of course, a website dedicated to phrenology (&lt;a href="http://www.phrenology.org/intro21.html"&gt;phrenology.org&lt;/a&gt;) which proclaims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phrenology is a true science, which is there to benefit humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly two hundred years after Gall founded his theories, we can look back and assess the real value and impact of Phrenology. Today,  much of the &lt;a href="http://www.phrenology.org/kritiek.html"&gt;criticism&lt;/a&gt; against Phrenology can be easily dismissed. However, we should be careful not to repeat the errors that were done in the past and that, through shameless commercial exploitation or through the pursuit of evil, have disgraced the science and given it a bad reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be curious how the site’s author deals with modern criticism of phrenology. He doesn’t. Rather, he addresses the 200 year old criticism that was mounted against Gall - as if it is still relevant today - and then ignores any of the points that are found in this summary.  The site simply asserts that phrenology has been scientifically demonstrate through observation (confusing observation for science) but provides no references. Rather we are treated with positive quotations about phrenology from the likes of Thomas Edison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phrenology is certainly an interesting notion from a historical point of view. It emerged out of a largely correct view of neuroanatomy, but then became rooted in clinical practice even while continued progress in neuroscience was rendering it obsolete. Its originator - Gall - combined legitimate basic science with hopelessly naive clinical claims. He can hardly be blamed, as clinical science had not yet been developed and accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phrenology persisted long past the time that it had been rejected by the scientific mainstream, as practitioners were reluctant to abandon a lucrative procedure, but eventually science won out. By that time it had evolved into just another manifestation of divination through cold reading, and so it is no surprise that it survives as just that.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s an organized crime racket that should not be legally protected because it happens to hide behind the label of religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I have a different attitude toward &lt;a href="http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/afp/090622/world/france_politics_islam_women_rights"&gt;France’s intention to ban burkas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We cannot accept to have in our country women who are prisoners behind netting, cut off from all social life, deprived of identity,” he said. “That is not the idea that the French republic has of women’s dignity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The burka is not a sign of religion, it is a sign of subservience,” he told lawmakers in a major policy speech. “It will not be welcome on the territory of the French republic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I hate the burka with ever fiber of my being. It exemplifies everything that is evil and wrong about religion and I completely agree with the sentiments expressed below. And I certainly do understand the potential security issues that France is particularly concerned about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as much as I abhor any culture that would deprive women of their dignity in such a way, I also believe that people have a fundamental right wear a burka if they so choose even if I don’t agree with that choice. I think the host of The Young Turks does a decent job of arguing this point in the following video:&lt;/p&gt;

The authors included two of our own SBM bloggers, Kimball Atwood and Wallace Sampson, along with Elizabeth Woeckner and Robert Baratz. It showed that the existing evidence on treating heart disease with IV chelation did not justify further study, and that the TACT trial was questionable on several ethical points. Their ethical concerns were taken seriously enough that enrollment in the trial was put on hold pending an investigation. It has now been re-opened after a few band-aids were applied to the ethical concerns. The scientific concerns were never addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have seen many critiques of the Atwood study, and not a single one has offered any cogent criticism of its factual content or reasoning. Most of them could have been written by someone who had not bothered to read beyond the title. Their arguments can be boiled down to a few puerile points that can be further simplified to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) I believe the testimonial evidence that chelation works.&lt;br&gt;
(2) Atwood and his co-authors are bad guys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Beth Clay has chimed in with an article entitled &lt;a href="http://www.jpands.org/vol14no2/clay.pdf"&gt;“Study of Chelation Therapy Should Not Be Abandoned.”&lt;/a&gt; I found it truly painful to read, but even the worst has some value as a bad example. Clay’s article could be used for a game of “Count the Errors.” I will point out some of them below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Content of Clay’s Critique&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has absolutely nothing to offer in rebuttal of the many scientific arguments in the paper, so she does what others do when they are “out of ammunition” or intellectually bankrupt. She resorts to ad hominem attacks and invents specious concerns. Her whole paper is beneath contempt. The sections of her article are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• The authors are biased.&lt;br&gt;
• They would not qualify as expert witnesses in court.&lt;br&gt;
• She lists the credentials of the principal TACT investigator.&lt;br&gt;
• She dismisses the study’s concerns about the other TACT investigators because she checked with licensing boards and “satisfied herself” that they were in good standing as of Sept 2008.&lt;br&gt;
• The authors’ qualifications are inadequate.&lt;br&gt;
• She offers a history of “the Quackbusters” and attacks Stephen Barrett.&lt;br&gt;
• Under “Why Chelation Needs to be Studied” she mentions only a consent agreement, one opinion (Lenfant) mentioning one testimonial, and an irrelevant study showing that men with high lead levels had more heart attacks.&lt;br&gt;
• She argues that the off-label use of drugs should be protected.&lt;br&gt;
• She claims that other harm is done by “Quackbusters.” By attacking the use of chelation for cardiovascular disease they “probably” hinder its use for lead poisoning.&lt;br&gt;
• Safeguards are built into the TACT protocol and harm to patients is unlikely. (Really? Two study-related deaths have already been reported: see http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=132 )&lt;br&gt;
• The ethical concerns raised by the article delayed TACT and resulted in a long, labor-intensive, and costly investigation at taxpayer expense. (The TACT study itself is far more costly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As her “Conclusions” she states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An important clinical trial has been hindered by publication of an agenda-driven 51-page article in MedScape, despite the lack of expert qualifications and known bias of the authors, and the fact that most authors derive income from legal compensation for testifying against medical professionals who use chelation or other alternative or complementary therapies in their practices. Investigation of off-label uses of FDA-approved drugs is essential for progress in medicine.&lt;br&gt;
The assertions of self-appointed “quackbusters” should not be accepted at face value, even if published in a prestigious venue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of her article, she offers this disclosure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My name is mentioned in passing in the article by Atwood et al. I have followed the chelation therapy controversy since 1994.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She does not disclose what the article revealed about her:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2000, the NCCAM’s National Advisory Council for Complementary and Alternative Medicine approved the “concept” of funding a large trial of chelation, by a vote of 11 in favor, none opposed, and 2 abstentions.[171] One of the speakers during the Public Comment session of that meeting was Beth Clay, a staff member of Rep. Burton’s House Committee on Government Reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has done much more than “follow” the controversy; she has actively supported chelation research and was instrumental in getting TACT approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What She Failed to Address&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She doesn’t acknowledge one of the important points of the Atwood study: the confusion between CaEDTA and Na2EDTA, the drug used in the TACT study. The TACT information says EDTA is approved for lead poisoning but that is only true for CaEDTA. Na2EDTA, the study drug, was never approved for lead poisoning. It was only approved for treatment of hypercalcemia and digitalis toxicity. It carried warnings that it was specifically contraindicated for arteriosclerosis. The FDA approvals for Na2EDTA &lt;a href="http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2008/pdf/E8-13273.pdf"&gt;have now been rescinded&lt;/a&gt;, meaning the study drug is now actually illegal in the US! Clay only perpetuates the confusion between calcium and sodium EDTA, making many of her comments nonsensical. Restrictions on Na2EDTA are irrelevant to the treatment of lead poisoning with CaEDTA. And it is not being prescribed “off-label” because there is no longer any labeled indication for using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atwood et al. showed that all the published evidence in favor of chelation for heart disease consists of uncontrolled case series that are poorly documented and of questionable significance, while every controlled study of chelation has consistently shown negative results. They have shown how this is consistent with many other rejected treatments where initial testimonials were wildly enthusiastic and case series were promising but RCTs were negative. They gave the example of internal mammary ligation which was rejected based on weaker evidence than we have for chelation. It was promptly discontinued after 3 controlled studies involving only 47 patients showed that it was no better than sham surgery. Even chelationists now agree that the scientific studies have ruled out any robust effect of chelation for heart disease, and they have been reduced to looking for smaller effects that might not have shown in the previous studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original rationale of chelationists was that removing the calcium from atherosclerotic plaque would help heart disease. When RCTs didn’t support that hypothesis, they shifted from that rationale to the idea that removing other heavy metals is helpful (an idea not supported by any evidence). Irrationally, they did not change their drug when they changed their hypothesis: they are still using the drug that removes calcium instead of the one that removes heavy metals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She isn’t concerned by the concerns Atwood et al. raised about the TACT investigators’ ethics. It doesn’t bother her that some of them were convicted felons, were involved in fraud, or had lost medical licenses for harming patients. It doesn’t bother her that they are strong advocates of chelation and use it in their practice. It doesn’t matter that their own websites are promoting an experimental study drug in violation of federal rules. It is enough for her that her own survey shows they currently hold valid medical licenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She defends the qualifications of Lamas, the principal TACT investigator. The study did not question his qualifications. It did question his statements about chelation, but Clay doesn’t address those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She calls TACT “well-designed” without answering Atwood et al.’s criticisms of its design, such as the unnecessary complication of providing two different levels of additional supplements and the multiple endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She doesn’t acknowledge that the TACT study will not settle the question. Its multiple endpoints make it likely that a spurious benefit will be found for at least one of them. Even if its results were resoundingly negative, it is highly unlikely that it would persuade chelationists to stop offering the procedure. The income of many of the investigators depends solely or largely on providing this treatment, and they believe in it with the kind of zeal that is often unresponsive to evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Authors’ Qualifications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expert witness standards she cites apply to conventional medicine. The courts do not require an expert witness to be a quack in order to testify against quackery. Anyway, this is a scientific paper, not a court case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clay points out correctly that the authors are not board-certified cardiologists, do not provide chelation therapy, and have slim research credentials. That doesn’t mean they aren’t eminently qualified to comment on the TACT study. You don’t have to be a smoker or treat lung cancer to be able to evaluate the published literature and see that smoking causes lung cancer. You don’t have to be a cardiac surgeon to reach a conclusion about internal mammary ligation based on studies showing it is no better than sham surgery. You don’t have to be a poor scientist to recognize poor science. You don’t have to be a logician to recognize errors in logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the authors HAD all been board-certified cardiologists, or had experience with chelation for approved indications like lead toxicity, or had better research credentials, would that have changed their findings or influenced their conclusions? That seems unlikely, since chelation for atherosclerosis has been condemned by the Medical Letter, the American Heart Association (AHA), the American College of Physicians, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, the American College of Cardiology, the American Medical Association, and the American Osteopathic Association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors have a special expertise that Clay doesn’t understand and that is not recognized by a formal board or organization. They are experts in recognizing poor science, pseudoscience, and health fraud. They have a deep understanding of the psychological factors that can lead even the best scientists to fool themselves. They have a combined wealth of experience and wisdom that would be hard to duplicate elsewhere. By long practice they have become skilled in detecting logical flaws and poor methodology in published studies. They have special expertise in evaluating the strength of evidence behind scientific claims. Their only “bias” is a bias in favor of science and reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that they are not government officials or applicants for research grants leaves them free to criticize government officials involved in unethical research. Washington insiders and critics of government bureaucracy should appreciate that their ability to look at this research from the outside is a strong advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clay’s comments about what she calls “Quackbusters” and about organizations like the NCAHF are irrelevant and gratuitous. What on earth does Stephen Barrett’s performance on a psychiatry board exam have to do with the subject under discussion? (I’m not going to believe what you write because someone who often agrees with you once failed a test?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She mentions the Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine as “the journal of which he [Sampson] purports to be editor in chief” and says it “claims to be a peer-reviewed journal” and she “wonders whether it is now defunct.” I recently received a new issue of that journal and Sampson is still listed, as he has been in every issue, as editor in chief. I can vouch for the fact that it is peer reviewed, as I have personally been both reviewer and reviewee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She tries so hard to find criticisms of Atwood that she even attacks the reputation of a large conglomerate that includes the hospital he is associated with on the grounds that 3 doctors who worked elsewhere in the conglomerate failed to report income from drug companies. She attacks Baratz because his clinic uses Botox and 16 Botox-associated deaths have been reported to the FDA. She uses that example to claim that EDTA is proved safe because more people have died from proper use of FDA approved drugs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She accuses the authors of misrepresenting their qualifications, but she has not shown that they did so. She questions their university affiliations because she “found no evidence that any of these authors actually teach or have ever taught academic courses.” The academic titles they list do not imply that claim; they indicate involvement in teaching in clinical settings. Not that it matters, but at least one of them HAS taught formal classroom courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her criticisms amount to nit-picking, innuendo, and irrelevant facts that do not impact on the authors’ qualifications to write this paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If she had anything intelligent to say about the content of the paper, she would have no need to resort to this kind of mean-spirited character assassination. Despite all her ad hominem venom, she fails to show that anything the authors wrote is inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ms. Clay’s Qualifications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She doesn’t think the authors are qualified to critique TACT, but she herself has no scientific qualifications. She accuses them of bias, but &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=517#ixzz0IoN4kzu2&amp;amp;D"&gt;her own bias is obvious.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;During her Capitol Hill tenure, Ms. Clay’s work focused on several breakthrough issues, including: complementary and alternative medicine, dietary supplement regulation, the epidemic rise in rates of autism spectrum disorders…..issues…..mercury and heavy metal toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is also a Scientologist, accepting beliefs written by a science fiction writer who had declared his intention to invent a religion. I wonder if she really believes Xenu brought billions of his people to Earth in DC-8-like spacecraft, stacked them around volcanoes and killed them using hydrogen bombs, and that the essences of these many people remained, and that they form around people in modern times, causing them spiritual harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you can forget I even mentioned her qualifications. Ad hominem considerations are really irrelevant. What matters is what she wrote, not who wrote it. And what she wrote is WRONG from beginning to end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Count the Errors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve already mentioned some of the errors, but here are a few more:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They claim that 30 deaths (etc.)” No, they presented evidence of least 30 deaths compared to the zero deaths claimed by the chelationist organization and tacitly accepted by the lead investigator of the TACT study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most authors derive income from legal compensation for testifying…” Atwood, the principal author, has not. Neither has Sampson. Baratz and Woeckner have been paid for time only in court cases, as stipulated in their disclosures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sampson, Atwood, and Baratz are members of a web of organizations and activities whose sole purpose is to stand against the use of chelation therapy and alternative medicine.” The only organization she mentions is the NCAHF, of which Atwood is not a member. The term “Quackbusters” is purely an invention of alternative medicine advocates, artificially lumping together all who question their claims. There is no “web” in any formal sense; there are only a lot of likeminded individuals who independently apply the same standards and therefore naturally reach the same conclusions about alternative medicine. The purpose of NCAHF and of the authors is not “to stand against chelation” but to apply science and reason to health claims and to reject those that are not supported by evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A tiny and shrill minority of physicians appears to stand against scientific inquiry.” No, a few clear-thinking physicians have spoken out against one specific study that violates the principles of scientific inquiry and that owes its existence to politics rather than to scientific judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“An internet search revealed a relationship between the Medscape Journal of Medicine and the NCAHF.” No, it only revealed that Stephen Barrett (who has nothing whatsoever to do with TACT or with the Atwood article) is a member of NCAHF and also a board member and occasional peer reviewer for Medscape. She represents this as “close ties” and thinks it is sufficient to raise questions about the veracity of the peer-review process and the true intentions of the journal! Then she unreasonably faults Atwood for not disclosing this information. Why on earth should he?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investigation of off-label uses of FDA-approved drugs is essential for progress in medicine.” Use of sodium EDTA isn’t off label because there is no longer a label to be off. Even when the label existed, it wasn’t being used off-label but anti-label, in direct disregard of a warning not to use it for this indication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is more, but I’ll stop here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clay’s article is a totally unreasonable, unconvincing attack on the Atwood article, filled with irrelevancies, misdirection, and ad hominems, devoid of any cogent discussion (or even acknowledgement) of the points made by Atwood et al. It doesn’t even distinguish between CaEDTA and Na2EDTA. I found the extensive personal attacks frankly offensive. This ideologically motivated hatchet job commits all the sins it would like to think the Atwood article commits, plus many more. It is a further disgrace to the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=99"&gt;already disgraced journal &lt;/a&gt;that published it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the fruits and vegetables on this list are obviously recognizable.  There are also crops that produce a product that we use, like &lt;a href="http://gears.tucson.ars.ag.gov/book/chap5/neem.html"&gt;Neem&lt;/a&gt; or cotton.  And, of premier importance to scientists everywhere: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://gears.tucson.ars.ag.gov/book/chap7/coffee.html"&gt;COFFEE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://gears.tucson.ars.ag.gov/book/chap5/cacao.html"&gt;CHOCOLATE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not plan a menu that features only foods and recipes created with the help of pollinating animals?  &lt;a title="North American Pollinator Protection Campaign" href="http://pollinator.org/resources.htm"&gt;NAPPC&lt;/a&gt; has some suggestions that will highlight all that pollinators do for us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baked Pita Chips with Artichoke Dip&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Artichoke – bee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Lemon Juice – bee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Onions – bee and fly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beef Brochette with Green Pepper &amp;amp; Tomatoes &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beef – beef cattle are fed bee pollinated alfalfa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tomatoes – bee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pepper – bee and fly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vanilla Ice cream with fruit/ chocolate sauce&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vanilla – bee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raspberries – bee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strawberries – bee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cacao – A fly. &lt;a href="http://www.amnh.org/sciencebulletins/biobulletin/biobulletin/story721.html"&gt;This tiny animal&lt;/a&gt; brings you chocolate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peppermint – fly and bee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a little after dinner drink…..&lt;strong&gt;Tequila Sunrise &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tequila -&lt;a href="http://www.batplants.co.uk/agavefinal.htm"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orange juice – bee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cherry – bee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, well, I guess you could have a cup of &lt;a href="http://gears.tucson.ars.ag.gov/book/chap7/coffee.html"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt;, as an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://louisville.bizjournals.com/louisville/stories/2009/06/22/daily2.html"&gt;Magnetic stimulation&lt;/a&gt; is to be combined with behavior therapy in an &lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov/"&gt;NIH&lt;/a&gt;-funded four-year clinical trial. It's reported that a pilot study "found that patients with autism 'have fewer tantrums and repetitive behaviors symptomatic of sensory overload after a low-frequency magnetic field is pulsed around their brains through a coil placed near the scalp.'" According to Dr. &lt;a href="http://louisville.edu/medschool/psychiatry/faculty-pages/manuel-casanova.html"&gt;Manual Casanova&lt;/a&gt;, the research is "exciting because it involves no drugs and virtually no side effects" (from &lt;a href="http://www.wkjk.com/cc-common/news/sections/newsarticle.html?feed=283307&amp;amp;article=5637904"&gt;WKJK&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
I'm curious about "sensory overload" being mentioned: This is something that has definitely been the case with my son, and more and more as he has gotten older. Sounds, words, language, the human voice: Charlie seems especially over-attuned to these. He's been plugging his fingers in his ears and I just ordered noise-cancelling headphones (the kind you wear when mowing a lawn-----the sound of lawnmowers definitely bothers him, so I guess these could help). (And they were &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/not_the_good_goods"&gt;not expensive stuff&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;p&gt;While I continue my investigations into/debate over/preparations for &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/words_arent_all_theyre_cracked_up_to_be"&gt;starting Charlie on an augmentative communication device&lt;/a&gt; (have you signed &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/actions/view/promote_the_use_of_augmentative_communication_devices"&gt;this pledge&lt;/a&gt;?), it occurs to me that I've been forgetting one thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; communicate. Not &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/a_little_talk_and_a_lot_of_pictures"&gt;always with words&lt;/a&gt;, it's true. I know that we need to focus on words or some sort of communication that would be readily understood by anyone; it would not do Charlie any good ultimately only to speak a sort of &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;client=safari&amp;amp;rls=en-us&amp;amp;defl=en&amp;amp;q=define:idiolect&amp;amp;ei=bLc_SozWJM-etweh6PUF&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=glossary_definition&amp;amp;ct=title"&gt;idiolect&lt;/a&gt; that only Jim and I kind of understand. On the other hand, all while we're teaching him to talk, he still has plenty that he needs to let us know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And sometimes, you know, the mountain has to go to Mohammed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, Jim and I are constantly striving to learn to understand what Charlie is telling us in ways other than with words. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We long ago realized that Charlie singing certain songs provided a clue about what he was thinking (for awhile, "Frère Jacques" meant distress and agitation). Also, some of the words that Charlie uses don't mean what they seem to, but rather say something else: He used to say "sushi" when he was really upset not because he was necessarily hungry. We divined that talking about things he liked comforted Charlie (he often says "Barney" and "GongGong" [=maternal grandfather in Cantonese] for the same reasons). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie leaves us plenty of signs of what's on his mind and of how he sees the world, like the arrangement----"four utensils with plates and containers"---illustrating this post. Once we went around moving the blocks and shoes he'd lined up. Today, we ask him if it's ok if we do and, when the arrangements are more studied (if that's the right word), we leave them be. I'd have to check my journal (I write down what we and Charlie do every night; have since he was a baby) to be sure, but I am getting the hunch that he makes more arrangements, and is more easy-going about them, when he's feeling in sync with things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Words can really get in the way. I was reminded of this yesterday when trying to explain to Charlie why, even though he'd just swam at the pool, it was too early to get dinner and, in particular, his latest favorite Chinese take-out item, chicken &lt;i&gt;chow fun&lt;/i&gt;. A few years ago, we realized that telling Charlie "no, we can't get X right now" or (trying to keep it simple) "no X" was very confusing to him. He heard and understood "no" but he still also heard and understood "X" and he wasn't sure whether he was going to get it or not, and unhappiness ensued. I've since learned, best not to mention X when Charlie's not going to get it and talk instead (if at all) about what is going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figuring this out occurred after a great deal of trial and even more error. Teaching Charlie to talk has meant understanding how Charlie uses words and how he thinks, and that's something best (only) learned from lotsa (quiet) time together.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org&amp;#39;s Autism Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245741841441"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=3624">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8ba1f3eb23699e4c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Cults"/><title type="html">St Petersburg Times vs. $cientology</title><published>2009-06-23T07:23:28Z</published><updated>2009-06-23T07:23:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/06/23/st-petersburg-times-vs-cientology/" type="text/html"/><media:group><media:content url="http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/84ccd467894d8e454d689effc211d515?s=96&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G"/></media:group><media:group><media:content url="http://www.tampabay.com/specials/2009/reports/project/images/Scientology-sm.jpg"/></media:group><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tampabay.com/specials/2009/reports/project/images/Scientology-sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.tampabay.com/specials/2009/reports/project/images/Scientology-sm.jpg" alt="" width="228" height="158"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The St. Petersburg Times has begun investigating $cientology. &lt;a href="http://www.tampabay.com/specials/2009/reports/project/#story_anchor"&gt;This led to a scathing piece about the cult, and particularly about its current leader, David Miscavige&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as is typical with $cientology, the investigation and the piece itself were only the beginning of the story. Once it was published, “the church” immediately let loose their attack dogs. And as is often the case, the extraordinary lengths they go to in order to defend themselves only sinks them further. So also available on the page linked to above is the continuing saga that is playing out as well as tons of more information $cientology doesn’t want you to know, broken up into whole chapters. No doubt, as I’m writing this very blog, Miscavige and his goons are locked in a board room somewhere trying to figure out their next tactic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original piece specifically focuses on the claims of 4 former high-ranking $cientologists turned $cientology critics. What I find hilarious is that $cientology’s current spokesman, Tommy Davis,  is pointing to old footage from decades ago of one of these critics, a former head of $cientology’s propaganda division,  very passionately defending Miscavige and “the church” from similar accusationsto the very  ones he is himself making today. Now this critic says that back then he was specifically under orders to lie his ass off to protect the cult. So now Tommy Davis is where he was back then, $cientology’s passionate defender whose job it is to destroy $cientology’s critics utterly even when it means being deliberately dishonest. It really makes me think of how hilarious it’ll be when Tommy Davis finally blows, becomes a critic himself, and some new flunky deliberately lies to destroy Davis’ character, so the cycle can continue. I can’t wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, also worth mentioning is &lt;a href="http://unreasonablefaith.com/2009/06/22/i-needed-a-job-and-xenu-was-hiring/"&gt;this awesome piece by someone who applied for a job with Narconon&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The new trend is hosting Psychic Parties which gives people a fun purpose for a gathering. It’s also a great way to add interest to any function whether it is social or business related. It opens the opportunity for people to get a &lt;a style="text-decoration:underline!important" href="http://www.free-press-release.com/news/200906/1245548748.html#"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000!important;font-weight:400;font-size:12px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000!important;font-family:Verdana;font-weight:400;font-size:12px"&gt;psychic &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000!important;font-family:Verdana;font-weight:400;font-size:12px"&gt;reading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; inexpensively”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not just for the rich and famous anymore.  Everyone wants to know what the future has in store for them,” says well known &lt;a style="text-decoration:underline!important" href="http://www.free-press-release.com/news/200906/1245548748.html#"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000!important;font-weight:400;font-size:12px"&gt;&lt;span style="border-bottom:1px solid #000000;color:#000000!important;font-family:Verdana;font-weight:400;font-size:12px;background-color:transparent"&gt;celebrity &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="border-bottom:1px solid #000000;color:#000000!important;font-family:Verdana;font-weight:400;font-size:12px;background-color:transparent"&gt;psychic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Rachael Bleau. She says her business has never been better with a who’s who list of celebrities who regularly seek her out. Due to the slowing economy people are seeking out psychics more than ever before to gain insight on where their life is heading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is so much wrong with this that it’s not even funny. Okay, maybe it’s a little funny picturing the rich and famous customers who have made their fortunes presumably without the aid of psychics to guide their every move now gathering around at parties letting some glorified street hustler not only bilk them out of their money but tell them how to live their lives like William Shater’s character in &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUFwdxEkP9U"&gt;that great Twilight Zone episode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevada has one of the worst vaccination rates in the nation.  The reasons are multifactorial.  Though there is a significant fraction of children who remain unvaccinated because of the distrust of vaccine safety spread by the current anti-vaccination movement, lack of health insurance, a large transitory population, and poverty (Las Vegas unemployment is now over 10%) also play a large role in its dismal vaccination rate.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>jeff@null.com (Joe Albietz)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245733630770"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/af55420caff49c8d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><title type="html">Wasp Spray</title><published>2009-06-23T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-06-23T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/crime/prevent/waspspray.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Is a can of wasp spray a preferable alternative to pepper spray for protection against assailants?</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245726693482"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1527">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fbbd2b39d6a4c333</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Linguistics in the comics"/><title type="html">Skeevy</title><published>2009-06-23T02:40:01Z</published><updated>2009-06-23T02:40:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1527" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are a bunch of insulting sk- words — &lt;em&gt;scummy, scurvy, scruffy, scuzzy, sketchy&lt;/em&gt; come to mind. And everybody, even a &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001630.html"&gt;snoot&lt;/a&gt;, seems to like negative-vibe phonetic symbolism. So if you try to make up a new word on this general pattern, say "skudgy", you'll probably find that &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=skudgy&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;aqi="&gt;many others&lt;/a&gt; have been there before you: &amp;quot;…by the next time we drag them out for bath-time play, we find that a skudgy sort of water is dispelled from the interior&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;The poet noted that the garage had a &amp;#39;skudgy down-to-earth-ness&amp;#39;&amp;quot;. Maybe &lt;em&gt;skudgy&lt;/em&gt; is just a portmanteau of &lt;em&gt;scummy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;sludgy&lt;/em&gt;, or maybe we need to recognize the resonance with other words like &lt;em&gt;scuzzy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;dingy&lt;/em&gt;; but in any case, it's out there, waiting to be re-invented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's how I reacted to the last word in today's Tank McNamara:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Skeevy.gif"&gt;&lt;img title="Click for a larger version" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Skeevy.gif" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I knew I'd heard it before, but I figured it was just another onomatopoeic amalgam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the OED, I was wrong. The gloss, as you'd expect, is "Disgusting, distasteful, or dirty; discomforting; sleazy". But the etymology is more interesting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;[&amp;lt; Italian regional (Tuscany) &lt;em&gt;schifo&lt;/em&gt;, adjective (&amp;lt; Italian &lt;em&gt;schifo&lt;/em&gt; (noun) sense of repugnance, nausea, disgust (1353 in Boccaccio) &amp;lt; Old French &lt;em&gt;eschif&lt;/em&gt; hostile, fierce: see ESCHEW &lt;em&gt;a.&lt;/em&gt;) + -Y. Cf. later SKEEVE &lt;em&gt;v.&lt;/em&gt;, SKEEVE &lt;em&gt;n.&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the first citation brings it close to home:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1976&lt;/strong&gt; J. D'ALESSANDRO in &lt;em&gt;Philadelphia Mag. &lt;/em&gt;Mar. 125/1 The word ‘skeevie’ used by South Philadelphians to indicate something disgusting is from Italian ‘schifare’, to loathe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Airplane?” He wanted the plastic model kits I keep up there, since my current apartment is a lifetime removed from the private basement bedroom I had in in high school, with its permanent card table splashed with enamel and covered with plastic parts of models under construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:160px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/06/models.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/06/models.jpg" alt="Image: upload.wikimedia.org" width="150" height="111"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: upload.wikimedia.org&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve stored boxes up there of models the boys and I have built. Some months ago, I began buying plastic models, mostly planes, for the boys and me to do together. (I’m not the most experienced parent in the world, but I do think that if you’re going to try to ensnare your sons in one of your retrospective hobbies, you’d better get to it before they’re 16.) For Alex I’ve bought simpler kits, snap-togethers of jets, and one tiny snap-together Fokker Triplane. It was &lt;em&gt;wicked&lt;/em&gt; cool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Alex, you want to build an airplane?” I asked him. “Airplane?” I had a few things to do but am always up for a 1/48th scale fighter plane, so I pulled down the box containing the parts of the Corsair I figured would be done by now in my unemployment, and the empty box of the snap-tight Spitfire the boys and I did a while ago. Alex opened the Spitfire box, and his face seemed to fall at seeing it empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Alex, you want to build a plane?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Build a plane?” This caught me a little by surprise. I was missing a lot of chances here as a dad of a child with autism, most notably the chance to get him to speak and write a full sentence motivated by a deep desire to do something at that moment. He grabbed my still-unbuilt Unemployment Corsair and twisted a fuselage half off the running. “Oh, Alex, wait!” Every chance he could break it that way. But of course that’s what I bought all these models for: not display, but to play with. The Spitfire is all busted up in their toybox right now, and that’s great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mind was just running toward the glue and the paints when Alex wandered away. He’ll be back. I’m hope I’m more ready when he is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is, of course, difficult to imagine choices more "central to personal dignity and autonomy" than measures to be taken for the prevention and treatment of disease -- measures that may be essential to preserve or extend life itself. Indeed, when the overwhelming moral issues that surround the abortion question are stripped away, what is left is a medical procedure determined to be "necessary" by an expectant mother and her physician.

&lt;p&gt;If the government cannot proscribe -- or even "unduly burden," to use another of the Supreme Court's analytical frameworks -- access to abortion, how can it proscribe access to other medical procedures, including transplants, corrective or restorative surgeries, chemotherapy treatments, or a myriad of other health services that individuals may need or desire?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If only the right to privacy had so much influence in government decisionmaking!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't even know where to start with Rivkin and Casey's argument, except to say that privacy is not going to stop government-supported (or even government-dominated) healthcare.  But it is fun to see the conservatives get all libertarian on you once they're out of power.  We'll be hearing "privacy this" and "my rights that" a lot.  Where were those rights during the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/27/opinion/27casey.html?_r=1"&gt;warrantless wiretapping&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110010670"&gt;FISA&lt;/a&gt; debates, by the way? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/06/is_government_health_care_unco.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/fZjJNj0rMzc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245716117556"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/06/22/carnival-of-space-108/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/554b52931b9df22a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Space"/><title type="html">Carnival of Space 108</title><published>2009-06-22T23:48:44Z</published><updated>2009-06-22T23:48:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/06/22/carnival-of-space-108/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wow, are we up to the 108&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Carnival of Space already?

SC GOV, MIA&lt;/a&gt;", MSNC, 6/22/2009):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The governor put in a lot of time during this last legislative session, and after the session winds down it's not uncommon for him to go &lt;strong&gt;out of pocket&lt;/strong&gt; for a few days at a time to clear his head. Obviously, that's going to be somewhat out of the question this time given the attention this particular absence has gotten. &lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;&lt;em&gt;[emphasis added]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I'm used to seeing "out of pocket" used to mean something like "expenses incurred without reimbursement", but not what what Mr. Sawyer clearly meant in this case, namely "out of reach, absent, unavailable". The same phrase was also used by another local political figure, quoted in the NY Daily News ("&lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/us_world/2009/06/22/2009-06-22_awol_gov_sanford_has_south_carolina_in_tizzy.html"&gt;AWOL South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford has entire state in a tizzy&lt;/a&gt;",  6/22/2009):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"The governor needs to be available to the people. He doesn't have to give the world his mobile number, but he's got to be where he can be contacted," said state Sen. Jake Knotts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"Nobody knows where he is. He's &lt;strong&gt;out of pocket&lt;/strong&gt;. They've been looking for him since Thursday."&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;[emphasis added]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is not, as I first thought, a malapropistic cliché, or perhaps a development from the idea of a football quarterback scrambling &amp;quot;out of the pocket&amp;quot; –  the OED gives the gloss &amp;quot;out of reach, absent, unavailable&amp;quot;, with citations going back a century:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1908&lt;/strong&gt; ‘O. HENRY’ &lt;em&gt;Buried Treasure&lt;/em&gt; in Ainslee's July 69/2 Just now she is out of pocket. And I shall find her as soon as I can.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O. Henry (William Sidney Porter) was born and raised in Greensboro NC, but Arthur Phillips is from Minnesota. Anyhow, whatever the geographical origins, I kind of like the idea of being "out of pocket", and perhaps I should try it myself.&lt;/p&gt;

Francis Collins comes up first. Atheists are shrill. Human genome. Morality is a pointer to god. C.S. Lewis. Fine tuning. Atheists are arrogant. Atheists are fundamentalists. Atheism is irrational. Read my BioLogos website. The usual appalling Collins drivel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up…you&amp;#39;d think anything would be a relief after that tepid, tired inanity, wouldn&amp;#39;t you? But no. Who is the complement to the pious, gullible, nice Dr Collins? Someone who might offer a different point of view? Someone who might spark some real discussion? Someone who might, you know, &lt;i&gt;disagree&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/a_revealing_review.php"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Barbara Bradley Hagerty&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jebus. What a pile of brainless, self-congratulatory pudding pretending to be a discussion of substance. And then the reporters in attendance dish it up with a spoon, and they gum it over with their soft, toothless questions, and everyone dies of sugar poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, I lied. The ending is even worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Francis Collins picks up his guitar and &lt;i&gt;sings&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Praise the source of faith and learning that has sparked and stoked the mind&lt;br&gt;
With a passion for discerning how the world has been designed. &lt;br&gt;
Let the sense of wonder flowing from the wonders we survey &lt;br&gt;
Keep our faith forever growing and renew our need to pray.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Started in 2005, APD is a new tradition--one that, maybe, has not yet settled into having a specific meaning to the community, or into an established routine.  Certainly not the same way as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_Pride_Day"&gt;Gay Pride Day&lt;/a&gt; which has been going strong for nearly 30 years.  And yet APD is being observed--&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://aspitude.blogspot.com/2009/06/autistic-pride-day-part-1-18-june-2009.html"&gt;in my city&lt;/a&gt; APD was celebrated by a gathering and flyer-handing-out in the public square; &lt;a href="http://asansouthwestohio.blogspot.com/2009/06/autistic-pride-day-event.html"&gt;in Ohio&lt;/a&gt; APD was celebrated with a visit to state representatives; other similar events were perhaps held elsewhere (add to comments?).  And Daily Kos blogger Pragmaticus took a different path to marking the day in his post &lt;a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2009/6/18/743986/-Reflections-on-Autistic-Pride-Day-by-Someone-With-Aspergers"&gt;Reflections on Autistic Pride Day by Someone With Asperger's&lt;/a&gt;.  Pragmaticus' take?  A day for educating the public about autism.  Part autobiography, part assumption and stereotype busting, all well written, Pragmaticus is good to his word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my Gay Pride Parade days, I remember the message I most wanted to communicate always being one of (firm, yes) acceptance and tolerance.  We're here.  We are human beings.  Treat us as such!  So in that same spirit, here's the closing paragraph of Pragmaticus' post,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We, the people of the autistic spectrum, all deserve to live free and equal lives.  But in so many cases, the intolerance of others makes us feel consigned to a life apart.  I do not accept this.  WE do not accept this.  So please, teach your children - in addition to gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or other characteristic, do not discriminate against the socially different.  All of us are created equal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are pride days for?  What do they mean?  How should they be celebrated?  Will Autistic Pride Day develop into its own strong tradition?  What will that tradition look like in 30 years? Only time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org&amp;#39;s Autism Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245711077128"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=7826">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/04127cbc7942305b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Attack of the Christian Mommies!</title><published>2009-06-22T22:00:44Z</published><updated>2009-06-22T22:00:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=7826" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/blog" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=24d25fbfe6afa77eacacbae93dec3b29&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This whole pregnancy thing, while exciting and awesome in it’s own way, can be so frustrating. I’ve got plenty of mommy-friends, between online and real life friends, but sometimes you just don’t want to call them every 5 minutes when your mood changes and you don’t know why. Because of this, I joined a website that was suggested to me. It has all of this neat stuff, like a growth chart and suggestions for pretty much everything you could think of – or at least everything I could think of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to relate to more pregnant women and new moms, I joined the website’s online community. It’s a series of discussion boards, groups and clubs, and each new member is automatically entered into a “birth club” for the month and year that they’re due (I’m in January 2010). As I scrolled through the main page of thread topics, it was evident that the majority of women in the community are devoutly religious. The most commonly used phrases I’ve seen (as you can find in a previous AI by &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?author=119"&gt;Elyse&lt;/a&gt;) are “It’s God’s plan,” and the like. “God didits” pepper each conversation I scrolled through. [...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After cringing and cursing under my breath, but before putting myself through any more torture, I posted my own thread, asking if there were any other rational/non-religious mommies-to-be. I was pleased with the response I started to get; there are a lot of other women on that site that had been thinking the same thing – I just asked first. As we all basked in the glory that is finding the few other people in the crowd that agreed with us, our bubble burst. We got trolled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[These are actual quotes from the thread comments - because they are direct quotes, I'm not editing them.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;I challenge anyone who has a skewed view of the God of the bible to actually read the bible themselves and then make up your mind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;With all the stars, galaxy, planets and comets, meteors, who keeps this earth rotating perfecting in Orbit around the sun and moon any closer or farther away we would just burn up or have no life or Oxgyen like all the other planets, who or what created life/earth?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;DO you think this all just happens on its own without any directions or do you believe we have Evolved from Apes? IF so  how come no one has ever witnessed a ape giving birth or turning into a Human, why did the evolution stop?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;You all say also that Scientist can explain things but that is just Theory, does not mean it is truth.  A thoery is just a THoery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Science can explain evolution but it cannot explain the origin of the Earth.  Evolution and religion can intertwine.  Even evolution and Creation can intertwine.  Unless you were there – nobody knows how the earth was created.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;[Someone]&lt;/span&gt; had mentioned that if there was research to prove creation, she wanted to see it…Well there is TONS! just google creation science or “The case for creation” by Lee Strobel. Here’s another site too…&lt;a href="http://www.creationscience.com/onlinebook/PartI.html"&gt; http://www.creationscience.com/onlinebook/PartI.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*FACEPALM*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These comments came from several different women, and as soon as they popped up in the thread they were dealt with by one of us. I still felt that they were worth sharing – and there were plenty more, as this conversation reached 10 pages. In the spirit of getting trolled, some people got heated, some people remained level headed, and some just left. Apparently I caused a bit of a stir, as there have since been a couple threads, started by Christian moms, directed towards atheists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;span&gt;Just becuase it is not what you believe does not mean we cannot express ourselves as we believe.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; Really? That’s interesting, because we were having a conversation amongst ourselves when you came busting in, in an attempt to save our withering souls.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there anywhere that’s safe from attack? I’ve since created a private group for Skeptical Mommies – I made it private because I wanted to maintain conversations without religious zealots crashing the party. If I want to fight about religion, I’ll go visit my great uncle.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chelsea</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245706303392"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/surely_we_can_do_better_for_autistic_adults">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/267ad44460bc819a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><title type="html">Surely We Can Do Better For Autistic Adults</title><published>2009-06-22T21:25:00Z</published><updated>2009-06-22T21:25:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/surely_we_can_do_better_for_autistic_adults" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://autism.change.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_AYtG1aBxgkI/SWwSigKqj2I/AAAAAAAAA9g/iWedJnFgt9k/s400/1.JPG" height="170" alt="Lock and key from http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_AYtG1aBxgkI/SWwSigKqj2I/AAAAAAAAA9g/iWedJnFgt9k/s400/1.JPG" style="float:right;border-color:initial;margin-top:0px;margin-right:8px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;padding:2px" width="200"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,25665017-2862,00.html"&gt;Luke deserves so much more&lt;/a&gt; is the headling for an &lt;a href="http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,25665017-2862,00.html"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in today's &lt;a href="http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,25665017-2862,00.html"&gt;HeraldSun&lt;/a&gt; about a 20-year-old autistic man who spends 20 hours of the day along, with food passed through a door by staff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; So bad are his symptoms that his heartbroken parents have been unable to care for him at home for the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of his violent tendencies, he now lives in a Department of Human Services residential property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He shuns human contact and even his carers are frightened to be in the same room with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Luke's parents, Mark and Ellen Modra, acknowledge that they are not able to take care of him, they make it very clear, the current circumstances that the Department of Human Services---"Human"???---has provided for their son is woefully inadequate (understatement).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When Luke goes out, he has to walk through a specially designed cage so he and his carers never share the same space," his father said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even DHS insiders, who asked not to be named, said Luke's carers were unable to handle him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They are really good at keeping him in isolation," a source said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His carers say they can't be in the same room as the strong young man because he can be violent. Luke's family admits he is no angel, but says he deserves better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There has to be a better, more humane way to deal with people with severe autism rather than just locking them up and throwing away the key," Mrs Modra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while Luke's situation is something more than extreme, Mrs. Modra's words ring true: How often are autistic individuals segregated from others ("society") and left, and the "key"---education, a way to communicate, other people, and more---thrown away?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org&amp;#39;s Autism Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245706109907"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/the_god_mob.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5c398719976dfae3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">The god mob</title><published>2009-06-22T21:57:22Z</published><updated>2009-06-22T21:57:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/ZCgF2_PqVbw/the_god_mob.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Speak the name "Templeton" and the prim, dutiful servants of the foundation will appear. If you look at the recent articles from &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/06/21/fighting-back-against-templeton/"&gt;Coyne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/article,3973,Correspondence-regarding-the-Templeton-Foundation,Richard-Dawkins-Daniel-Dennett-AC-Grayling-Edwin-Cartlidge"&gt;Dawkins&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/the_name_templeton_foundation.php"&gt;me&lt;/a&gt;, you'll discover the same comment, shown below, from a representative of the Templeton Foundation. I've seen these guys in action before. They are very serious, somber fellows in their nice suits, with the dignitas of boodles of cash behind them, who will calmly state their position with an air of dispassionate certitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They remind me of Mafia lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A.C. Grayling and Daniel Dennett have refused to talk to a serious
journalist (Edwin Cartlidge of Physics World) about a serious subject
(philosophical materialism) because the journalism fellowship under
which he is pursuing this subject is sponsored by the Templeton
Foundation. They will have nothing to do with the Templeton Foundation,
they say, because our aim is somehow to "muddy the waters" about the
relationship between science and religion.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
That's not how we see it at all. First-rate, peer-reviewed science is
essential to our work at the Foundation and to the progressive vision
of the late Sir John Templeton, who was deeply committed to scientific
discovery. Many of our largest grants go to pure scientific research
(like our support for the Foundational Questions Institute in Physics
and Cosmology, the Godel Centenary Research Prize Fellowships, and the
Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But, yes, we do like to include philosophers and theologians in many of
our projects. Excellent science is crucial to what we do, but it is not
all that we do. We are a "Big Questions" foundation, not a science
foundation, and we believe that the world's philosophical and religious
traditions have much to contribute to understanding human experience
and our place in the universe. For Grayling and Dennett to compare this
rich, expansive discussion to a dialogue with astrologers is silly.
They know better. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Gary Rosen&lt;br&gt;
Chief External Affairs Officer&lt;br&gt;
John Templeton Foundation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Materialism, philosophical or otherwise, is a serious and useful subject. The bit he left off, though, is that the Templeton Foundation &lt;i&gt;opposes&lt;/i&gt; it. For instance, they give a series of prizes, many of which reward people for making the best excuses for inserting superstition into research: the &lt;a href="http://www.templeton.org/prizes/the_templeton_prize/"&gt;Templeton Prize&lt;/a&gt;, for "affirming life's spiritual dimension"; the &lt;a href="http://www.templeton.org/prizes/john_templeton_award_for_theological_promise/"&gt;Award for Theological Promise&lt;/a&gt;, for the best thesis on "God and spirituality"; the &lt;a href="http://www.templeton.org/prizes/templeton_religion_reporter_of_the_year/"&gt;Religion Reporter of the Year&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href="http://www.templeton.org/prizes/templeton_european_religion_writer_award/"&gt;European Religion Writer of the Year&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href="http://www.templeton.org/prizes/templeton_religion_story_of_the_year/"&gt;Religion Story of the Year&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href="http://www.templeton.org/prizes/the_epiphany_prize/"&gt;Epiphany Prize&lt;/a&gt;, for shows that "increase man's understanding and love of God"; the &lt;a href="http://www.templeton.org/prizes/the_kairos_prize/"&gt;Kairos Prize&lt;/a&gt;, for movies that &amp;quot;result in a greater increase in either man&amp;#39;s understanding or love of God&amp;quot;; you get the idea. Let&amp;#39;s have no illusions. First and foremost, the Templeton Foundation&amp;#39;s purpose is the promotion of religion…they have simply chosen to pursue that goal by dressing up as philanthropists supporting a certain kind of science. They are what the Discovery Institute wishes they could be, if they were staffed with grown-ups and had $1.5 billion to play with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They do aim to muddy the waters. They want to blur the boundaries between legitimate science, which questions traditional dogma, and religion, which &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; traditional dogma, by playing favorites with religion in a game that apes scientific institutions. Yes, they certainly do spend money on real science projects; it&amp;#39;s part of their aim to entangle valid, secular science in the financial webs of a religiously motivated agency. Again, look at the Mafia for a model. Diversify and get your hands in real businesses like trucking or garbage collection or construction, and when someone asks difficult questions, just say &amp;quot;Hey, look — fleet of garbage trucks!&amp;quot; And meanwhile, build up a network of obligations — do a little, perfectly legal favor for some little guy, and when the time comes, you can ask him to return the favor, to your advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now of course, the Templeton Foundation is doing nothing illegal, and the comparison to a criminal organization does not extend to actual criminality. The only place it holds up is in the way they maintain a pretext of doing one thing, while actually profiting most off another activity altogether. Look at Mr Rosen's comment. Nowhere does he admit outright that what they fund is the introduction of a religious perspective in science. Instead, we get euphemisms. They are a "Big Questions" foundation, whatever that means. He will not come right out and state plainly that what they think is a "Big Question" is the role of a god in creating and maintaining the universe and humankind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's not a big question. It's a bad question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never found a discussion with a theologian about their favorite deities to be &amp;quot;rich, expansive&amp;quot; — just saying it is so doesn&amp;#39;t make it so, but is actually the crux of the argument. They are trying to buy their way into the debate, rather than earning it. I don&amp;#39;t think they know Grayling and Dennett very well at all, either, because they do know better, and the comparison with a dialog with astrologers is spot on — they won&amp;#39;t be disavowing it any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll stand by my Mafia comparison, too. It's an organization that gets a lot of mileage out of making offers people can't refuse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/the_god_mob.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/ZCgF2_PqVbw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245706051760"><id gr:original-id="http://jaycueaitch.wordpress.com/?p=286">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0df629a238222053</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Homeopathy Awareness Week</title><published>2009-06-22T21:12:16Z</published><updated>2009-06-22T21:12:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://jaycueaitch.wordpress.com/2009/06/22/homeopathy-awareness-week/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">[BPSDB]

I have been reminded of a prediction made in the &lt;a href="http://www.touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=17-06-060-i"&gt;July/August 2004 issue of Touchstone magazine&lt;/a&gt;. Brace yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where is the ID movement going in the next ten years? What new issues will it be exploring, and what new challenges will it be offering Darwinism?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dembski:&lt;/b&gt; In the next five years, molecular Darwinism—the idea that Darwinian processes can produce complex molecular structures at the subcellular level—will be dead. When that happens, evolutionary biology will experience a crisis of confidence because evolutionary biology hinges on the evolution of the right molecules. I therefore foresee a Taliban-style collapse of Darwinism in the next ten years. Intelligent design will of course profit greatly from this. For ID to win the day, however, will require talented new researchers able to move this research program forward, showing how intelligent design provides better insights into biological systems than the dying Darwinian paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man, I'm glad I'll be on sabbatical. It'll give me a year to patch up the radical changes I'll have to make in all of my courses after the ID revolution comes. The rest of you are going to be coming back to rubble in September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although, I should also mention that the very next paragraph in that article is the one credible paragraph Paul Nelson ever wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nelson:&lt;/b&gt; Easily the biggest challenge facing the ID community is to develop a full-fledged theory of biological design. We don't have such a theory right now, and that's a real problem. Without a theory, it's very hard to know where to direct your research focus. Right now, we've got a bag of powerful intuitions, and a handful of notions such as "irreducible complexity" and "specified complexity"--but, as yet, no general theory of biological design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost five years on, still no theory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/put_your_affairs_in_order_biol.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/WjR7xfLjhYs" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245701592188"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/the_complaints_department_is_o.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7e1859e2b38a3f71</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Administrative"/><title type="html">The Complaints Department is open</title><published>2009-06-22T20:54:35Z</published><updated>2009-06-22T20:54:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/tOkXgXoDYc8/the_complaints_department_is_o.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;You little scamps in the comments have been acerbic and rude and loud again, haven't you?

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear PZ Myers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
My name is Petter XXXX and I am a graduate student in biology at University of XXXX, as well as active as an ecology consultant in XXXX.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

I would be grateful for the removal of slanderous comments directed personally at me on your blog Pharyngula.
I have nothing but admiration for your work with not allowing creationism or ID be a part of education, although fortunately that is not a big problem in Europe.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

I commented on your blog that I thought it was unnecessary to riddicule people of faith.
I think it hurts the reputation of scientists frankly.
But that is my opinion, and I fully respect if you do not agree.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

However, on your blog I am called
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

comment 131. Petter the ignorant rude jerk troll:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

comment 187: Petter the lying christofascist troll.You are not a scientist. Stop lying. Your grammar, spelling, logic, and word usage are at the level of a highly religious moron. I'll pray for you to leave your cave of darkness, mental fog, lies, and hate. Petter, time to pull out the xian default.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

comment 189: "This comment accuses me of sponsoring terrorism", it is likely to fall under "slander per se"
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

comment 191: Comments referring to sexual actions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

comment 192: Accuses me of impending human rights, would have a pretty good chance to fall under "slander per se" to.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

I fully understand that it is hard as a blogger to keep up with editing posts that go over the line, and I am aware of that you did not write the comments.
However, you being the author of the blog I kindly ask you to remove all comments above.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

A copy of this mail has been sent to my legal representative, in case further actions would be necessary.
I however hope that we can stop here, by you removing the comments.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Best regards,
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Petter XXXX&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uh-oh. He's quite right, you know. You've been saying unkind things about people, like for instance calling them &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/a_miracle.php#comment-1725035"&gt;ignorant, rude, and a jerk&lt;/a&gt;. We can't have that kind of thing going on in a blog, now can we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, wait. Yes, we can. I rather like plainspoken responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And look, he's asking me nicely, with only the slyest of implications of legal action, to delete &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; comments, but doesn't seem to think his own warrant censure. I'll have to think about whether I should do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, done. No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a general suggestion to the thin-skinned who think about commenting here: don't do that. No one gets treated gently here; even I sometimes hesitate at dipping a toe into the bacon-chummed shark-, piranha-, and candiru-infested waters here. You will get abused. And if you do get abused, don't come crying to me to protect you, because I'll just do something even ruder, like taking your plea and tossing it back into the deepest, murkiest, roiling whirlpool I can, and if you didn't like getting a few boo-boos before, you'll really hate the public flensing that will ensue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And please, please, &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; write to tell me that your favorite authority figure, whether it is your lawyer or your mommy, will come after me if I don't do your bidding. It makes me cranky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, I've done the complainer the favor of removing the bits from his letter that would reveal details of his identity. What makes this complaint especially stupid is that all any of the cruel, cruel commenters know about him is his very common first name; unless he thinks he is the only Petter in the world, he has not yet been exposed to any public or professional ridicule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, if someone starts harrassing me with futile legal documents, I can fill in those blanks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/the_complaints_department_is_o.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/tOkXgXoDYc8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245699482601"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/06/iran_likes_dpi_too.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f71a94887dd55b2e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Privacy"/><title type="html">Iran Likes DPI Too</title><published>2009-06-22T16:55:43Z</published><updated>2009-06-22T16:55:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~3/OJrEtP6Do-k/iran_likes_dpi_too.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Christoper Rhoads and Loretta Chao &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124562668777335653.html"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; in today's Journal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...the Iranian government appears to be engaging in a practice often called deep packet inspection, which enables authorities to not only block communication but to monitor it to gather information about individuals, as well as alter it for disinformation purposes, according to these experts.

&lt;p&gt;The monitoring capability was provided, at least in part, by a joint venture of Siemens AG, the German conglomerate, and Nokia Corp., the Finnish cellphone company, in the second half of 2008, Ben Roome, a spokesman for the joint venture, confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article later clarifies that the actual creator of Iran's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_packet_inspection"&gt;deep packet inspection&lt;/a&gt; (DPI) technology is not certain.  But I blog for a different point.  A group of companies, including ISPs and new advertising firms have proposed DPI for advertising purposes.  The idea is that if you were to allow your internet tracking to be analyzed and used for targeted advertising, this could offset the cost of providing internet access.  The proposals have largely failed in the US, because of legal, privacy, and business problems with the plan.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The holy grail advertising technologies are the same types of tools that governments would like to use for norm setting, criminal enforcement, and terrorism prevention.  It's interesting to see how advertisers and governments are interested in similar technologies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/06/iran_likes_dpi_too.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/OJrEtP6Do-k" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245698954345"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=13689">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/edb36a3b58c6c34a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="environment"/><category term="pollution"/><title type="html">Carbon Offsets: More Questions Than Answers</title><published>2009-06-22T19:13:03Z</published><updated>2009-06-22T19:13:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/22/carbon-offsets-more-questions-than-answers/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/" type="html">Can industrialized nations save the world with a &lt;a href="http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/forests_for_the_trees/"&gt;plan&lt;/a&gt; to offset their carbon emissions by paying developing nations to stop cutting down their forests?

For one, the battery life isn’t as bad as I’d thought. Probably due to some combination of firmware updates (got the third one today), me not playing with it incessantly, and learning to turn instant messenger off when not in use, I’m now getting through the day with very little trouble. If I pull it off the Touchstone in the morning and head in to work, I’ve usually still got 50-70% when I get home. I’m going on a trip Sunday, so we’ll see how it performs on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Touchstone is pretty much the awesomest thing ever. You set your phone on it and it charges. If someone calls you can push the answer icon and it automatically goes to speakerphone. Or you can pick up and it automatically answers. The magnet in that thing is very strong, so even though you have to orient the phone just so to get it to charge, it’s almost hard not to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://themaroon.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/clip_image002.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="border-bottom:0;border-left:0;display:inline;border-top:0;border-right:0;margin:5px 10px 5px 0" title="clip_image002" border="0" alt="clip_image002" align="left" src="http://themaroon.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/clip_image002_thumb.jpg?w=146&amp;amp;h=194" width="146" height="194"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pre is turning out to be one of the most hacker-friendly devices ever produced. Palm has published all of the &lt;a href="http://www.palminfocenter.com/news/6889/palm-posts-webos-open-source-packages/"&gt;open source packages&lt;/a&gt; they’ve used and modified. People have already got Doom up and running. And with one exception (in which &lt;a href="http://news.idg.no/cw/art.cfm?id=E5A15F84-1A64-6A71-CE4A7B0996659883"&gt;Palm politely asked&lt;/a&gt; a developer forum to stop talking about tethering at Sprint’s behest in order to maintain positive vibes between all parties) they’ve been pretty encouraging. So despite the lack of a hardware-level SDK, I’m pretty encouraged about the future of the currently rather empty app store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are definitely a few improvements I’d like to see. For one, the ability to click a YouTube link found in a web page and have it load in the YouTube app. That app works perfectly, and that seems like a rather trivial feature to implement so I don’t really understand why this functionality is missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tethering would be nice, if only so I could stop reading donkeys whining about the lack of it online. I had tethering on my previous phone (EVDO Rev A on Verizon’s network) and it worked as well as tethering does anywhere, but it still sucked so much that I just went back to purchasing the $10/day Wi-Fi from hotels. It’s one of those things that sounds cool, until you want to watch a YouTube video or download something from Bittorrent. Plus how often do you really want to use it? Especially with a device like the Pre, which already does much of what you’d use a laptop for anyway, it seems like a low priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally would like to see (and suspect we will before long) a soft keypad that works in landscape mode in browsers and apps. The physical keyboard is still unbeatable for typing out emails/SMSes/Tweets/IMs. But sometimes when you’re surfing the web, which for me is nearly always in landscape, you only need to enter a few characters (for instance to find a friend in Facebook’s search box) and for that an optional soft keypad would be really handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the same note, I’d like a little more spelling correction and predictive typing. Apple had to add that to their phone to make up for the general crappiness of soft keypads, but Palm probably figured it unnecessary since they’ve got a dedicated QWERTY. And while they’re correct, it would be really, really nice. They do a little, automatically capitalizing the first word of a sentence, inserting an apostrophe into obvious contractions, and changing &amp;quot;u&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;, but that’s about it. Because the keypad is such a superior input mechanism they should use a spelling-corrector that’s significantly less aggressive than Apple’s and just covers the basics, but they still should have that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better copy and paste would be very useful as well. As far as I can tell, right now all you can do is copy from one editable text field to another inside the same card. That borders on uselessness. I got a cool app to keep my encrypted passwords, but I can’t paste them into a browser. Since I use Roboform on my 3 computers, most of my logins are some 12 digit randomly-generated string of numbers and letters. Typing them is a major hassle, and involves me switching from one card to another and back again over and over. Please, oh please let me cut and paste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video recording would be a nice touch, and is one of the features whose absence I notice most. This is just software people, and any $20 clamshell can do it. It was ridiculous that Apple didn’t have that for 2 years (and still doesn’t on all but the newest model, despite the fact that third parties have proven it’s possible) and it’s ridiculous that Palm doesn’t now. I expect Palm will fix this too, since their current SDK wouldn’t enable a third-party to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IM client on the Pre makes iPhone users with their crappy third-party apps jealous, but I wish they’d do something about the battery drain like automatically logoff after ten minutes of non-use. I’d also like to see Yahoo! and MSN added, though people digging through the code have found what would appear to be those under development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the way the Messaging app combines SMS and IM, showing me them both together in one thread and automatically responding using the last used protocol. It’s fantastic. What I don’t like is that it continues to use IM even when the person is signed off. In those cases I’d prefer it to automatically switch back to SMS, though at least they make it very easy to do manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another goofy thing about the phone I discovered is that data roaming is turned off by default. Thankfully you just enable it once and then forget about it, but that’s sort of odd since Sprint requires you to get an all-you-can-eat plan in which that’s included, unlimited and for no extra charge. For only $70/month I get 450 peak minutes, nights starting at 7pm, unlimited EVDO Rev A data on both Sprint and Verizon’s networks (thanks to roaming) and unlimited text-messaging. (Anandtech’s awesome Pre review shows just how great&lt;a href="http://www.anandtech.com/gadgets/showdoc.aspx?i=3586&amp;amp;p=9"&gt; Sprint’s pricing&lt;/a&gt; is, and hilariously shows a Target ad that’s clearly contextual because if you click it, it takes you to a light up plastic palm tree.) Maybe Sprint requested that of Palm in order to keep costs down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally I had written that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d also like the ability to easily clear email notifications. They stick around until you click them and load the email app, even if you delete it through your desktop client on Exchange (or presumably Gmail). It’d be nice if I could swipe them off to the side like you can do with many things to get rid of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I realized I hadn’t even tried it so I pulled out the phone and gave it a shot. It worked! Kudos Palm, kudos.&lt;/p&gt;

Superficially, this might seem like a fairly easy question:  the incompatibilities between Western omelets and pork allergies seem pretty obvious.  But I was able to use a sophisticated philosophical argument to convince him that everything would be okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My inspiration was Stephen Jay Gould’s concept of &lt;a href="http://metamagician3000.blogspot.com/2009/06/noma-no-more-great-accommodationism.html"&gt;NOMA&lt;/a&gt;, or Non-Overlapping Magisteria.  This principle establishes the fundamental compatibility of science with religion, arguing that the two simply don’t address similar questions, and therefore cannot come into conflict.  Science deals with the workings of the world (”is” questions), while religion deals with ethical behavior (”ought” questions), so there is way they can be incompatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this spirit, I have developed what I like to call the principle of Non-Overlapping Food Groups, or NOFOG for short.  The basic argument is as follows:  throughout history, humans have divided our culinary products into a set of grand groupings.  Among these are the Egg Group and the Pork Group.  Clearly these are non-overlapping:  eggs come from chickens, while pork comes from pigs.  Q.E.D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I don’t know about you, but a Western Omelet falls squarely within the Egg Group where I am from.  Growing up in our small house in the Pennsylvania suburbs, I would look forward to eggs every Sunday morning, most often in the form of a yummy Western Omelet.   While the identification is not perfect, we won’t go far wrong by recognizing the Western Omelet as a crucial component of the Egg Group on which we all depend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, since the Egg Group is non-overlapping with the Pork Group, and my friend’s allergies are only to pork, the NOFOG principle justified encouraging his interest in ordering the omelet.  I’ll be visiting him in the hospital tomorrow, hopefully he’s feeling better.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sean</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245697470125"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/06/22/skeptically-speaking-online/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0a577b59a610369c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="JREF"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Skeptically Speaking online</title><published>2009-06-22T19:00:08Z</published><updated>2009-06-22T19:00:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/06/22/skeptically-speaking-online/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The interview I did with the folks at Skeptically Speaking &lt;a href="http://skepticallyspeaking.com/2009/06/13/astronomy/"&gt;is now online on their website&lt;/a&gt;.

(It just sorta worked out that way this week...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Steven Drake of &lt;a href="http://notdeadyetnewscommentary.blogspot.com"&gt;Not Dead Yet&lt;/a&gt; (and regular, appreciated commenter here) has &lt;a href="http://www.autube.tv/conversation-stephen-drake"&gt;a podcast up on AuTube&lt;/a&gt;.  This month's &lt;a href="http://autube.tv"&gt;AuTube&lt;/a&gt; topic is "how does being on the spectrum shape personal relationships?"--includes expert footage from Steven Shore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Ari Ne'eman has an essay on history, advocacy, taking control of our lives, and other related topics up at the &lt;a href="http://aapdinterns.blogspot.com/2009/06/history-speaks-to-us-ari-neeman.html"&gt;AAPD Interns blog&lt;/a&gt;.  Recommended action after reading: follow the whole &lt;a href="http://aapdinterns.blogspot.com"&gt;multi-author blogstream&lt;/a&gt;!  I think this may be my new favorite blog site (must take care not to get lost there for hours instead of doing other work...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Amy Roloff from the TV show &lt;a href="http://tlc.discovery.com/fansites/lpbw/lpbw.html"&gt;Little People, Big World&lt;/a&gt; did &lt;a href="http://media-dis-n-dat.blogspot.com/2009/06/amy-roloff-says-people-with.html"&gt;an interview&lt;/a&gt; wherein she discusses topics surrounding acceptance, communication, and empowerment.  Positive and pragmatic, and more than just a little familiar (to me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Paravicini"&gt;Derek Paravicini&lt;/a&gt;, a blind, autistic, musical prodigy is &lt;a href="http://www.sonustech.com/paravicini/"&gt;currently touring&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2009/06/the-winners-of-the-3-quarks-daily-2009-prize-in-science.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/06/charmquarkaward.jpg" alt="Charm Quark award winner"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pleased and a bit surprised to learn that &lt;a href="http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2009/06/the-winners-of-the-3-quarks-daily-2009-prize-in-science.html"&gt;a blog post from Bad Astronomy was awarded third place in the 3 Quarks Daily science blog contest&lt;/a&gt;! A couple of my posts were submitted, but there were a lot of really good essays entered from other blogs (I spent a couple of hours reading that I should have spent on other things, but man, there was a lot of interesting stuff there) and I didn’t expect to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Steven Pinker chose my &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/05/13/ten-things-you-dont-know-about-hubble/"&gt;Ten Things You Don’t Know About Hubble&lt;/a&gt; post as third place, with the first and second place spots going to &lt;a href="http://www.daylightatheism.org/2009/02/bands-of-iron.html"&gt;Bands of Iron&lt;/a&gt; at Daylight Atheism (a beautifully-written piece on life and the ancient Earth) and &lt;a href="http://southernfriedscience.com/2009/02/16/the-ecological-disaster-that-is-dolphin-safe-tuna/"&gt;The Ecological Disaster That Is Dolphin Safe Tuna&lt;/a&gt; (an interesting take on saving one species versus many) at Southern Fried Science. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As promised &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/05/27/a-new-blog-prize-the-quarks/"&gt;when I mentioned this contest a few weeks ago&lt;/a&gt;, I am donating the $200 prize money to the &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/about-the-foundation.html"&gt;James Randi Educational Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (of which, in the interest of full disclosure, I am President). Besides being a fine non-profit charity dedicated to bringing the light of science and reason to the world, this also will ease any residual guilt I might have for plugging a contest for which I was a candidate. And, hint hint: &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/support-us.html"&gt;the JREF &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; accept donations through the web&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope all my BABloggees out there will go over to 3QD and the other contestants’ sites and add them to your feed reader. There are a vast, vast number of good science blogs out there. Those are great places to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thanks to everyone for this, especially to whoever submitted the Hubble post, and of course to Steven Pinker and 3 Quarks Daily.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245690943751"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/scienceonline09_interview_with_1.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4c51c290d1cbddc0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="SO'09 Interviews"/><title type="html">ScienceOnline'09: Interview with Sol Lederman</title><published>2009-06-22T15:56:24Z</published><updated>2009-06-22T15:56:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/HG8kgWpfxlo/scienceonline09_interview_with_1.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/sbc08_interviews/" title=""&gt;The series of interviews&lt;/a&gt; with some of the participants of the 2008 Science Blogging Conference was quite popular, so I decided to do the same thing again this year, posting interviews with some of the people who attended &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/" title=""&gt;ScienceOnline'09&lt;/a&gt; back in January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We kick off the series with the interview with Sol Lederman who gave a &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/Show-and-tell/" title=""&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt; session: &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/US_DoE/" title=""&gt;US Dept of Energy Office of Scientific and Technical Information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Who are you? What is your (scientific) background? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="SolLederman.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/SolLederman.jpg" width="300" height="400" style="float:right;margin:0 0 20px 20px"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I'm not a scientist and I don't play one on TV either. I'm a techie. My education is in Mathematics and Sociology. I've worn many hats in the computer industry throughout the years - programmer, tech support person, writer, trainer, and consultant are some of the roles I've had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do you want to do/be when (and if ever) you grow up?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to communicate about computers. I especially like the potential of Web 2.0. Lately I've been getting into building apps with Drupal, including layout and php code. So, maybe I'll evolve into a social application builder or into a writer or consultant about these things. Or maybe I'll do something completely different. Basically, I'm happy doing what I'm doing now and I'm in no hurry to grow up and be something else/different/more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is your Real Life job?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wear a couple of hats: blogger and consultant. I do a variety of things for the US Department of Energy Office of Scientific and Technical Information (&lt;a href="http://www.osti.gov/" title=""&gt;OSTI&lt;/a&gt;). I &lt;a href="http://www.osti.gov/ostiblog" title=""&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; for OSTI, I explore ways of getting OSTI resources more visibility, and I do some consulting and programming for them. I also blog about federated search for the &lt;a href="http://federatedsearchblog.com/" title=""&gt;Federated Search Blog&lt;/a&gt;, a blog sponsored by &lt;a href="http://deepwebtech.com/" title=""&gt;Deep Web Technologies&lt;/a&gt;. Federated search is the technology that aggregates scholarly information from the "Deep Web"; that's the part of the Web that Google can't crawl. OSTI has a number of federated search applications whose search is powered by Deep Web Technologies. My relationship with OSTI started with supporting some of their apps while I was working full time for Deep Web and has morphed into a consulting relationship with both parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication, and in particular the use of the Web in science, interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm very interested in how Web 2.0 technologies can bring scientists together. I'm a member of a Web 2.0 Innovation Team led by OSTI technologist Mike Jennings. I can't speak in any detail about what we're doing but we're looking at ways of extending the scope of OSTI's reach into the world of Web 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of your readers might not be aware that OSTI's precursor was founded to manage information pursuant to the Manhattan Project. &lt;a href="http://www.osti.gov/mission" title=""&gt;OSTI's mission&lt;/a&gt; is &amp;quot;to advance science and sustain technological creativity by making R&amp;amp;D findings available and useful to &lt;a href="http://www.energy.gov/" title=""&gt;Department of Energy (DOE)&lt;/a&gt; researchers and the public." So, OSTI is all about science communication and OSTI has a strong Web presence through applications like &lt;a href="http://science.gov/" title=""&gt;Science.gov&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://worldwidescience.org/" title=""&gt;WorldWideScience.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your job? Do you have a blog and if so, will you tell us about it, your experience in science blogging? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogging is a moderate part of my work for OSTI. It's a much larger role at Deep Web. In a year and a half I built the Federated Search Blog from zero readers to over 800. I'm quite proud of that and I believe the blog has been a good marketing piece for Deep Web. Not related to any paid work, I write a Math blog, &lt;a href="http://wildaboutmath.com/" title=""&gt;WildAboutMath.com&lt;/a&gt;. Mostly I challenge people with Math problems and give prizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always get good ideas about how OSTI can further its outreach at conferences. That's why I attend. I vividly remember a long conversation with Wired blogger Aaron Rowe. He instilled the importance of using multiple Web 2.0 channels to reach the public. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ostigov" title=""&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; is just one example of how OSTI is taking that insight to heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to meet you and thank you for the interview. I hope to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NAS has always been interested in science communication, but the advent of teh toobz has obviously changed the game. A lot of voices advocating reality are rising now that were unheard before, and the web is their (our!) medium. So they asked me to come and talk about this to the staff, and, even better they’ve opened this to the public. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/framing-science/2009/06/national_academies_to_host_sem.php"&gt;Matt Nisbet has scheduling details&lt;/a&gt;; my talk is at 12:30 - 1:30 at the NAS building (500 Fifth Street, N.W.

In an hour long segment, all sorts of wild claims were made about MMR by the host, covering the full spectrum from the vaguely reasonable to the nonsensical. Health professionals who phoned-in to the show were shouted down, while a homeopath caller was given free rein to make a range of wild accusations. In short, it was a travesty, so much so that a complaint was made to OfCom, who have today issued &lt;a href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/obb/prog_cb/obb136/Issue136.pdf"&gt;their ruling&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to note is that OfCom ruled that the show was not in breach of broadcasting regulations. The reasons why are quite interesting though. OfCom investigated the show with respect to two rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.2&lt;/b&gt; – factual programmes or items or portrayals of factual matters must not materially mislead the audience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5.13&lt;/b&gt; – local radio services must not give undue prominence to the views and opinions of particular persons or bodies on matters of political or industrial controversy and matters relating to current public policy in all the programmes included in any service taken as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking these two regulations in turn, LBC argued that the show did not &lt;i&gt;"stray into the bounds of providing factual information that mislead listeners"&lt;/i&gt;; and that the phone-in format of the show with four out of six callers disagreeing with the host ensured that no undue prominence was given to the views which Barnett.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding point 2.2, what's interesting is that OfCom's ruling looks at whether the program as a whole misleads the public, rather than any specific comment within it. They had some criticism of Barnett:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At times, it appeared that during this broadcast the presenter relied upon her anecdotal experience and was not adequately briefed on the wider public health issues and prevailing medical advice which this debate would undoubtedly also touch upon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on the subject of bias also observed that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"...undue prominence may include the presenter, as appropriate, paying due respect to callers putting forward a view with which he or she disagrees. For example, in this case the contributions of the two mothers who had not immunised their children were positively endorsed and appreciated by the presenter with comments such as “This is fascinating” and “Fantastic…I know I shouldn’t be biased…” In comparison, Jeni Barnett’s treatment of the nurse who criticised her handling of the topic was at times dismissive and impatient."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is interesting criticism, but OfCom's criteria for ruling are rather different:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In considering Rule 2.2, however, our decision was ... based on whether, taken as a whole, the content of the programme would have left listeners with the overall impression that the MMR jab was dangerous thereby influencing parents not to immunise their children." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OfCom felt that overall the arguments from the four out of six callers who questioned Barnett's stance - who included two health professionals - were enough to counterbalance the daftness. The same reasoning  applied to 5.13, with the regulator commenting that the presence of the four callers provided the necessary balance to ensure that the show overall was not biased towards giving one set of views greater prominence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary then, OfCom felt that the show was fair, balanced, and overall did not mislead the public. And that's where the problems start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first issue is that (as far as I can interpret from the ruling) if the doctor and nurse hadn't phoned-in to the show to challenge Barnett, then OfCom might have adjudicated against the show. I can see the logic of this from the point of view that the producers ensure balance by allowing those calls to be heard; but at the same time the host was clearly biased, and it seems strange to me that this is deemed acceptable within the context of the wider show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second issue is by fair the most glaring though, and it's our old friend: "fair-and-balanced" reporting. In adjudicating on this case, OfCom have fallen into the same journalistic fallacy that plagues much of our news output - the idea that two opposing views should be given equal weight regardless of their actual sanity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see this a lot in science reporting. Some crank gets a paper published with a crappy new theory that virtually nobody else in the scientific community accepts, yet the press report it as a two-sided debate, giving equal prominence to both sets of views. The result is to give the audience the impression that the fringe theory carries far more weight and support than it actually does. By striving to be "fair-and balanced" in this way, broadcasters unwittingly create output strongly biased in favour of the fringe view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two sides to the MMR debate. One side has the support of the science, the evidence, and pretty much the entire global medical community. The other is pushed by a handful of fringe groups, a few scare-mongering reporters, and assorted quacks. Giving equal prominence to the two sides of this debate is like balancing a report on Darwin by devoting equal time to the view that maybe a magic man in the sky just made everything in six days. Except that in this case it's a lot worse, because spreading nonsense about creationism probably won't endange childrens' lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dendrochronology is the study of tree-rings to determine when and where a tree has grown. Everybody knows that trees produce one ring every year. But the rings also &lt;i&gt;vary in width&lt;/i&gt; according to each year's local weather conditions. If you've got enough rings in a wood sample, then their widths form a unique "bar code". Collect enough samples of various ages from buildings and bog wood, and you can join the bar codes up to a reference curve covering thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dendrochronology has a serious organisational problem that impedes its development as a scientific discipline and tends to compromise its results. This is the problem of proprietary data. When a person or organisation has made a reference curve, then in many cases they will not publish it. They will keep it as an in-house trade secret and offer their paid services as dendrochronologists. This means that dendrochronology becomes a black box into which customers stick samples, and out of which dates come, but only the owner of the black box can evaluate the process going on inside. This is of course a deeply unscientific state of things. And regardless of the scientific issue, I am one of those who feel that if dendro reference curves are produced with public funding, then they should be published on-line as a public resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is a resistance movement: amateur dendrochronologists such as my buddies Torbjörn Axelson and Åke Larsson. They practice &lt;a href="http://web.utk.edu/~grissino/default.html"&gt;open source data transparency&lt;/a&gt; on the net, which means that arguably amateur dendrochronology is at this time more scientific than the professional variety. Torbjörn recently published a &lt;a href="http://www2.hemsida.net/taxelson/dendro/obj/zorg.pdf"&gt;fascinating study&lt;/a&gt; of a wooden building in Dalecarlia, showing that it was originally built in ~1240 and then refurbished in the 1490s, the 1570s and the 1830s. If you doubt his results, then just re-run the analyses. His data are all there in the report. I came into contact with Torbjörn through &lt;i&gt;Aard&lt;/i&gt; and then had the pleasure of seeing his &lt;a href="http://fornvannen.se/pdf/2000talet/2007_187.pdf"&gt;2007 debate piece&lt;/a&gt; into print in &lt;i&gt;Fornvännen&lt;/i&gt;, introducing many other professionals to the issue. (English translation &lt;a href="http://www.cybis.se/forfun/dendro/taxelson/index.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the guys have started a wiki and &lt;a href="http://www.cybis.se/wiki/index.php?title=Husaby-G%C3%B6khem-G%C3%B6teve-Kestad_oak"&gt;dug into Alf Bråthen's work&lt;/a&gt;. Alf (born in 1924) is an old-school non-computerised dendrochronologist who hasn't generally published his reference data. He once famously dropped nine years from his pine curve for Gotland, causing Johan Rönnby to unwittingly publish an erroneous date for the Bulverket lake settlement in his 1995 PhD thesis. Torbjörn and Lars have re-analysed some data from Västergötland that Alf has released, and whaddaya know: there are errors there too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point here isn't to say that Alf Bråthen is an unusually clumsy dendrochronologist. He probably isn't. The point is that all scientists are fallible, and that science moves forward through discussion. We help spot each other's mistakes, and once an issue has been wrangled over and everybody's had a chance to check the details, we have more secure knowledge than can ever be attained by a few people tending their black box. But as long as data and methods stay in that box, the process is impeded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update 24 June:&lt;/b&gt; Here's something really scary. Says Torbjörn,&lt;blockquote&gt;The most problematic issue from an archaeological perspective may be that the Hohenheim data (Germany), which forms a lot of the basis for radiocarbon calibration, is not open to inspection. Nobody outside the "circle of the initiated" has seen the measurement series nor the average chronologies. We know that European dendrochronologists have often used the &lt;i&gt;Gleichlaufigkeit&lt;/i&gt; method (GLK), which is not dependable, but which places great demands on the skill of the analyst. If you run GLK "blindly" you can end up anywhere. Anybody who says so in public, though, is likely to make few friends.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Indeed, back in the 1983-1984 school year I was in college living in a house with five other guys, and one of my roommates was a a total Apple geek. He had, as one might expect, an Apple IIe, and I immediately decided that, when it came to computers, I definitely liked the Apple product better than the IBM PC that my other roommate had. Of course, at the time I was nowhere well off enough to be able to afford either, but these two roommates were both computer science majors. They had to have a computer; and both somehow came up with the cash. (Back in those days PCs cost several thousand dollars.) In any case, my first experience with the Macintosh dated back to the original Macintosh, delivered to my Apple-loving roommate through a student discount plan in the early part of 1984. I immediately fell in love with the machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize that my younger readers will have a hard time believing this, but it's true and it wasn't at all uncommon in the 1980s. I didn't own a computer for about eight years after that, including through medical school and the first two years of graduate school. Instead, I had to rely on computer lab machines and, later, the machine's in my Ph.D. thesis advisor's laboratory, which, fortunately, was a Macintosh. The first computer I ever bought for myself was a Mac LC; I could barely scrape together the cash. Now that I'm incredibly fortunate enough (especially in this economy) to have a good income, I have a MacBook Pro and a Mac Pro at home; my wife has a MacBook; and I have multiple Macs in my lab, all relatively new, even though our IT department is about as Mac hostile as it can be without simply banning Macs and requiring Windows XP boxes. Fortunately, that is changing, thanks to my insistence and that of two other faculty who prefer Macs. Finally, Mac geek that I am, I even bought an iPhone 3 GS on the day it was released. (Yes, I like it. A lot.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of which is a revisitation (or, depending on your point of view, a regurgitation) of why I care about Apple and why what happens to Steve Jobs interests me. Last year, when Steve Jobs was looking gaunt and various reports were coming out about his health, full of dire speculation about what was wrong with him, I wrote a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/whats_wrong_with_steve_jobs.php"&gt;post about what I suspected to be going on&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, Jobs had had a neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas, for which he had &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/03/woo_for_cancer_say_it_aint_so_steve.php"&gt;undergone a pancreaticoduodenectomy&lt;/a&gt; (colloquially known as the Whipple procedure) in 2004. As I pointed out at the time, Jobs had been incredibly lucky in that the mass discovered growing in the head of his pancreas turned out not to be a run-of-the-mill pancreatic cancer (adenocarcinoma of the pancreas), which has an absolutely dismal five year survival. (&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/abusing_celebrities_with_cancer_to_sell.php"&gt;Patrick Swayze&lt;/a&gt; has metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and has thus far beaten the odds by surviving more than a year since his diagnosis.) Rather, it turned out to be a rare type of tumor known as a neuroendocrine tumor, which, in contrast to pancreatic cancer, is eminently curable with surgery. A year ago, I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/whats_wrong_with_steve_jobs.php"&gt;speculated&lt;/a&gt; that the reason for Steve Jobs' gaunt appearance was a complication from his Whipple operation, specifically the dumping syndrome. When earlier this year Steve Jobs took a leave of absence from Apple for a few monthsi due to an "endocrine disorder," I was, quite frankly, flummoxed. I couldn't reconcile the reports with my previous speculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a story in the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; is correct, it would appear that I was pretty darned wrong. Indeed, if this story is correct, it would appear that Steve Jobs &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124546193182433491.html"&gt;underwent a liver transplant&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/whats_wrong_with_steve_jobs_revisited.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/whats_wrong_with_steve_jobs_revisited.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/ihhbF6LSuJQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry></feed>
